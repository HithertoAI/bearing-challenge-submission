v153 METHODOLOGY: DUAL-BAND SPECTRAL FUSION (ULTRASONIC + GEOMETRIC)
Technical Approach:
* Framework: Frequency-Domain Ensemble.
* Voter 1 (Friction): Ultrasonic Energy (35-45 kHz) using v135 "Stitched Quiet Segment" logic.
   * Weight: 70% (The proven baseline).
* Voter 2 (Resonance): Geometric Fault Band Energy (3000-6000 kHz).
   * Target: Covers the challenge-specified fault frequencies (3781 Hz, 4408 Hz, 5781 Hz).
   * Weight: 30% (The structural modifier).
* Fusion Logic: Weighted Rank Average.
* Incident Files: Fixed at ranks 51, 52, 53.
Physical Rationale:
* The "Silent Stage 2" Hypothesis: Previous analyses (v135-v152) relied solely on Ultrasonic energy (Stage 1 Friction). While effective, this blinded the model to "Transition" files—bearings that are still low-friction (quiet) but have begun to structurally resonate at their natural frequencies (Stage 2).
* Geometric Validation: The challenge documentation explicitly lists fault band centers in the 3-6 kHz range. High energy in this band, even in the absence of ultrasonic noise, indicates structural stiffness changes characteristic of advancing fatigue.
* Correcting the "Healthy" Bias: Historical "healthy" files (e.g., File 25, 35) exhibit low ultrasonic noise but anomalously high geometric resonance1. This method correctly penalizes them, pushing them later in the timeline to reflect their true structural state.
Key Innovation:
* Identification of "Imposter" Files: Discovered that files historically assumed to be "Start" files (25, 35) possess high resonance energy (Ranks 30+ in Geometric band), reclassifying them as mid-stage degradation.
* New Genesis Definition: Establishes File 15 and File 6 as the true mechanical baseline, as they exhibit minimum energy in both frictional and resonant domains.
Implementation:
1. Ultrasonic Processing (v135 Legacy):
   * Extract 10th percentile "quiet segments."
   * Bandpass 35-45 kHz.
   * Compute Baseline Energy.
2. Geometric Processing (New):
   * Bandpass 3000-6000 Hz (Full signal).
   * Compute Total RMS.
3. Fusion:
   * Composite = (0.7 * Rank_Ultra) + (0.3 * Rank_Geo).
   * Sort Ascending.
4. Submission: Append incident files 33, 51, 49.
Validation:
* Timeline Inversion: Significant re-ordering of the top 10 compared to v135 (Avg Shift: 4.08 positions).
* Convergence: File 15 is unanimously identified as Rank 1 by both voters, creating a stable new anchor for $t=0$.
* Divergence: Successfully separates files with similar friction levels based on their resonant structural integrity.
Results:
* Generated a 53-file timeline that accounts for both surface friction (Stage 1) and structural resonance (Stage 2).
* Challenges the "Plateau" by re-evaluating the assumed starting order of the dataset.
