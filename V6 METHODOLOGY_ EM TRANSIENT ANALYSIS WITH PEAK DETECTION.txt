V6 METHODOLOGY: EM TRANSIENT ANALYSIS WITH PEAK DETECTION


Building on our RMS foundation, V6 introduces electromagnetic transient analysis to capture short-duration fault signatures that RMS alone may miss.


Key Innovation:
- Adds high-pass filtering to isolate EM transient bursts
- Implements peak detection to count and measure impulse events
- Combines steady-state RMS with transient energy metrics
- Captures both continuous degradation and intermittent fault signatures


Technical Approach:
- Primary feature: RMS vibration energy (proven baseline)
- EM transient detection: 1kHz high-pass Butterworth filter
- Peak detection: Height = 2σ, Minimum distance = 100 samples
- Combined metric: RMS + (Transient Energy × 0.1 weighting)


Physical Rationale:
- RMS: Measures overall vibration energy (continuous wear)
- Transients: Capture EM bursts from early bearing faults
- Peak counts: Quantify intermittent fault occurrences
- Combined: More comprehensive degradation assessment


Results:
- Detected 61,162 transient peaks across dataset
- Transient energy range: 4.6M to 17.8M units
- Complements RMS with high-frequency fault signatures


This approach maintains our robust RMS foundation while adding sensitivity to early-stage fault transients that may precede full degradation.
