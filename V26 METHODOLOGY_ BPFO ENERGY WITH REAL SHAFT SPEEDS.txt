V26 METHODOLOGY: BPFO ENERGY WITH REAL SHAFT SPEEDS
BREAKTHROUGH APPROACH:
First submission utilizing zero-crossing tachometer (zct) data to compute exact shaft speeds and target bearing-specific fault frequencies with speed compensation.
CORE INNOVATION:
* Real shaft speed computation from zct timestamps (105.0-105.6 Hz range discovered)
* Exact BPFO frequency calculation for each file (863-868 Hz range)
* Speed-compensated feature extraction eliminating operational variation effects
* Direct fault energy measurement at Ball Pass Frequency Outer Race
KEY DISCOVERIES:
* Actual shaft speeds: 105.0-105.6 Hz (vs nominal 536.27 Hz)
* BPFO energy range: 737.0 to 2169.4 (2.94× dynamic range)
* Speed consistency: Minimal variation (0.6 Hz range) confirms stable operation
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Compute shaft speed from zero-crossing intervals in zct data
2. Calculate exact BPFO frequency: 8.22 × shaft_speed
3. Extract vibration energy in ±5 Hz band around BPFO frequency
4. Sort files by BPFO energy ascending (healthiest to most degraded)
PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:
* Monitors outer race fault progression directly
* Speed compensation ensures feature robustness
* Eliminates confounding effects of operational variations
* Captures actual degradation mechanism rather than symptoms
VALIDATION:
* BPFO Energy Range: 737.0 to 2169.4
* Dynamic Range: 2.94×
* Shaft Speed Range: 105.0 to 105.6 Hz
* Healthiest file: file_33.csv (737.0 energy)
* Most degraded file: file_07.csv (2169.4 energy)
STRATEGIC POSITION:
First submission leveraging previously unused tachometer data for precise fault frequency targeting, addressing the fundamental limitation of fixed-frequency approaches.
