V15 METHODOLOGY: SIMPLE STATISTICAL FEATURES


Returns to classic bearing degradation indicators with weighted combination.


APPROACH:
- RMS: Overall vibration energy
- Kurtosis: Impulsiveness indicator (increases with bearing faults)
- Crest Factor: Peak-to-RMS ratio (indicates impact severity)
- Combined Score: RMS + (10 × Kurtosis) + (5 × Crest Factor)
- Ranking by increasing combined score


RATIONALE:
- All three features typically increase with bearing degradation
- Kurtosis is sensitive to early-stage bearing faults
- Crest factor detects impact events characteristic of bearing damage
- Simple weighted combination avoids over-engineering


INDUSTRY STANDARD:
These are well-established bearing health indicators in condition monitoring.
