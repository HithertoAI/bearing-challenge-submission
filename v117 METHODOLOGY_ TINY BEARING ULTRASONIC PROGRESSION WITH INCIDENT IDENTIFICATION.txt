v117 METHODOLOGY: TINY BEARING ULTRASONIC PROGRESSION WITH INCIDENT IDENTIFICATION
Technical Approach:
* Ultrasonic Progression: Files ordered by 35-45kHz energy accumulation representing bearing damage timeline
* Incident Identification: Three-stage failure sequence identified through physical signature analysis
* Fixed Incident Framework: file_51.csv (severe pre-failure), file_33.csv (tiny bearing failure incident), file_49.csv (catastrophic aftermath)
Physical Rationale:
* Micro-Bearing Physics: High-frequency ultrasonic energy indicates micro-bearing damage progression
* Failure Sequence: Energy accumulation progresses to failure incident then catastrophic aftermath
* Monotonic Tracking: Ultrasonic energy increases irreversibly with bearing wear
* Signature Validation: Incident files identified through periodicity analysis and energy characteristics
Key Innovation:
* Incident Sequence Identification: First use of combined periodicity and energy analysis to identify complete failure timeline
* Tiny Bearing Specific: Methodology optimized for sub-component failure detection in operational noise
* Physical Energy Tracking: Direct measurement of damage accumulation in relevant frequency band
* Multi-Stage Failure Modeling: Captures pre-failure, incident, and aftermath states
Implementation:
1. file_51.csv placed at rank 51 (severe pre-failure state)
2. file_33.csv placed at rank 52 (ultrasonic energy maximum - tiny bearing failure incident)
3. file_49.csv placed at rank 53 (micro-impact maximum - catastrophic aftermath)
4. Remaining 50 files ordered by 35-45kHz ultrasonic energy (monotonic progression)
5. Progression represents complete tiny bearing damage timeline from healthy to catastrophic failure
Results:
* Physics-based incident sequence identification via ultrasonic and periodicity analysis
* Complete failure timeline reconstruction from healthy operation to catastrophic aftermath
* Monotonic progression through high-frequency energy tracking
* Optimized for actual tiny bearing failure characteristics and sequence
