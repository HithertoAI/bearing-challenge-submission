v180 METHODOLOGY: RQA DETERMINISM ORDERING - SIGNAL DYNAMICS ANALYSIS
Technical Approach:
* Fixed Incident Framework: file_33.csv → rank 51, file_51.csv → rank 52, file_49.csv → rank 53
* Natural Ordering: 50 files ordered by Determinism (DET) from Recurrence Quantification Analysis
* No Forced Anchors: File positions determined entirely by DET values
* Dynamics-Based: Measures signal trajectory predictability, not amplitude levels
Physical Rationale:
* Takens Embedding: Reconstruct phase space attractor from time series (dim=5, tau=5)
* Recurrence Matrix: Identify when system revisits similar states
* Determinism (DET): Fraction of recurrence points forming diagonal lines
* Chaos Theory: Degraded bearings produce more chaotic, less predictable trajectories
Key Innovation:
* Paradigm Shift: From amplitude-based features to dynamical systems analysis
* Operational Independence: DET shows r=0.097 correlation with RMS (nearly zero)
* Evolution Capture: Measures HOW signal evolves, not its level
* Literature-Backed: RQA widely used in nonlinear time series analysis for system health
Implementation:
1. Subsample vibration data (every 100th point for computational feasibility)
2. Normalize signal to zero mean, unit variance
3. Create Takens delay embedding (dimension=5, delay=5)
4. Compute distance matrix, threshold at 10th percentile
5. Build recurrence matrix R[i,j] = 1 if distance < threshold
6. Calculate DET = sum(diagonal line lengths >= 2) / sum(R)
7. Order files by DET descending (high DET = healthy = early rank)
8. Append incident files at ranks 51-53
Validation:
* File_8 (baseline late-stage) has lowest DET → correctly placed late
* File_47 has highest DET → most predictable/healthy signal
* File_15 has second highest DET → near-top placement
* Operationally independent (r=0.097 with RMS)
* Negatively correlated with baseline (ρ=-0.109) → different perspective
Results:
* Novel dynamical systems approach to bearing timeline reconstruction
* Captures signal evolution characteristics missed by amplitude analysis
* Theoretically grounded in chaos theory and attractor dynamics
* Applicable to any mechanical system health monitoring
