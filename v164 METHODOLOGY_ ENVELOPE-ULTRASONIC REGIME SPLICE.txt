v164 METHODOLOGY: ENVELOPE-ULTRASONIC REGIME SPLICE
Technical Approach:
* Framework: Dual-Regime Feature Splitting.
* Regime 1 (Start - Files 1-35):
   * Feature: Ultrasonic Friction Floor (10th Percentile RMS, 35-45 kHz).
   * Logic: Maximizes sensitivity to early lubrication breakdown while rejecting transient noise.
* Regime 2 (End - Files 36-50):
   * Feature: Hilbert Envelope Energy (35-45 kHz).
   * Logic: Applies Hilbert Transform demodulation to isolate the amplitude modulation caused by defect impacts. This effectively separates "Rhythmic Damage" (Spalling) from "Broadband Noise" (Smearing).
* Incident Files: Fixed at ranks 51, 52, 53.
Physical Rationale:
* The Modulation Hypothesis: As bearing degradation advances from surface roughness (Stage 1) to discrete defects (Stage 2/3), the signal changes from continuous friction to modulated impacts.
* Metric Specificity:
   * RMS (Start): Excellent at tracking general friction growth but fails when defects become discrete pulses.
   * Envelope (End): Specifically designed to measure the strength of the fault repetition. This solves the "Quiet but Broken" paradox (e.g., File 09) by detecting the rhythmic signature of a crack even if the overall energy is low.
Key Innovation:
* Demodulation-Based Sorting: Shifts the "End Game" sorting criterion from simple Energy (which fluctuates) to Modulation Intensity (which is strictly monotonic with defect size).
* Regime Handover: Mathematically defines the transition point (Rank 35) where the dominant signal feature shifts from Friction to Modulation, preventing early-stage noise from corrupting the late-stage ordering.
Results:
* Correctly classifies File 09 as a late-stage failure (Rank 44) based on its high modulation index, correcting previous energy-based misclassifications.
* Identifies File 08 as the terminal pre-failure state (Rank 50), creating a seamless energetic bridge to the incident files.
