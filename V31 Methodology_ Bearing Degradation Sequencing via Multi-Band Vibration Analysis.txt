V31 Methodology: Bearing Degradation Sequencing via Multi-Band Vibration Analysis
Technical Approach
V31 implements a physics-based bearing failure progression model using multi-band vibration analysis to detect distinct degradation stages:
Early-Stage Degradation
* Detected in low-frequency band: 250-2500 Hz
* Characterized by rising RMS energy indicating initial surface fatigue
Advanced-Stage Degradation
* Detected in high-frequency band: 10,000-24,000 Hz
* Characterized by high-frequency energy rise indicating widespread damage
Key Features Calculated
1. Low-Band Energy: RMS energy in 250-2500 Hz band
2. High-Band Energy: RMS energy in 10,000-24,000 Hz band
3. Damage Progression Ratio: High-band/Low-band energy ratio
4. Overall Vibration Energy: Total signal variance
5. Signal Impulsiveness: Kurtosis measurement
Health Assessment Formula
text
health_score = variance × 0.4 + high_band_energy × 0.3 + damage_ratio × 0.2 + kurtosis × 0.1
Ranking Methodology
* Files sorted by health_score (lowest = healthiest, highest = most degraded)
* Final ranking: healthiest bearing → most degraded bearing
Scientific Basis
Based on established bearing failure progression principles where different failure stages manifest in distinct frequency bands, with advanced damage showing characteristic high-frequency signatures.
