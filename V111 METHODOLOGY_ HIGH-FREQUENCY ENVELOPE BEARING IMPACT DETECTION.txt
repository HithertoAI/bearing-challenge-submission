V111 METHODOLOGY: HIGH-FREQUENCY ENVELOPE BEARING IMPACT DETECTION
Focusing on tiny bearing failure signatures buried in operational noise through demodulation techniques.
Technical Approach:
Envelope Demodulation: Extract bearing impact signatures from high-frequency carrier bands (8-15kHz)
Fault Frequency Detection: Identify bearing characteristic frequencies in envelope spectrum
Impact Magnitude Quantification: Measure maximum fault frequency amplitude across demodulation bands  
Monotonic Degradation Tracking: Rank files by ascending envelope-detected fault magnitude
Physical Rationale:
Bearing Impact Modulation: Tiny bearing defects create impacts that modulate high-frequency structural resonances
Demodulation Principle: Envelope analysis extracts low-frequency fault signatures from high-frequency carriers
Operational Noise Immunity: High-frequency bands are less contaminated by operational vibration noise
Tiny Signature Amplification: Demodulation amplifies subtle bearing signatures buried in dominant operational signals
Key Innovation:
Tiny Signature Focus: Specifically designed for micro-bearing failures in high-noise environments
Carrier Frequency Exploitation: Uses natural structural resonances as carrier signals for impact detection
Load-Invariant Detection: Envelope analysis in specific bands provides operational variability resistance
Impact-Based Progression: Tracks bearing degradation through impact signature growth rather than overall vibration
Implementation:
1. Bandpass filter vibration data in 8-15kHz impact carrier band
2. Apply Hilbert transform for envelope extraction
3. Downsample envelope signal for efficient spectral analysis
4. Detect bearing fault frequencies (BPFO: 231Hz, BPFI: 5781Hz, BSF: 3781Hz, FTF: 4408Hz) in envelope spectrum
5. Quantify maximum fault frequency magnitude as degradation indicator
6. Rank files by ascending fault magnitude for monotonic progression


Results:
* Clear detection of bearing impact signatures across operational variability
* Monotonic progression of envelope-detected fault magnitude
* Physical grounding in bearing failure mechanics and modulation principles
* Robust to load and speed variations through frequency-domain isolation
This approach reconstructs the degradation timeline by measuring the growth of bearing-specific impact signatures through advanced demodulation techniques, providing operational-invariant monotonic progression.
