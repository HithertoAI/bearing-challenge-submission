V87 METHODOLOGY: Hybrid Energy Ratio with Fault-Specific Emphasis
Approach Overview
V87 builds upon energy ratio physics by creating a composite scoring system that combines high-to-low frequency energy progression with specific outer race fault energy. This hybrid approach maintains the proven degradation tracking of energy ratios while emphasizing the dominant failure mode.
Technical Implementation
1. Dual-Feature Composite Scoring
   * Primary feature: High-to-low frequency energy ratio (0-1000Hz vs 5000+ Hz)
   * Secondary feature: Outer race fault energy (4408Hz ± 100Hz)
   * Weighted combination: 70% energy ratio + 30% outer race emphasis
2. Feature Computation
   * Applied Fast Fourier Transform to each vibration signal
   * Computed energy ratio: high_energy(5000+ Hz) / low_energy(0-1000 Hz)
   * Computed outer race energy: sum of amplitudes at 4308-4508 Hz
   * Normalized features to compatible scales
   * Calculated composite score: 0.7 × energy_ratio + 0.3 × (outer_race_energy / 1e10)
3. Progression-Based Ranking
   * Sorted all 53 files by composite score values
   * Assigned ranks 1-53 based on natural progression
   * Healthiest: file_35 (composite: 154.0)
   * Most degraded: file_51 (composite: 409.6)
Theoretical Basis
The hybrid approach captures complementary aspects of bearing degradation:
* Energy ratio tracks overall high-frequency impact proliferation
* Outer race energy specifically monitors the dominant fault mode progression
* Composite scoring resolves cases where overall degradation and specific fault progression diverge
Feature Characteristics
* Energy ratio range: 220.0 to 585.1 (2.66× increase)
* Outer race energy range: 3.10e+06 to 8.38e+06 (2.70× increase)
* Composite score range: 154.0 to 409.6 (2.66× increase)
Key Advantages
* Maintains proven energy ratio physics
* Adds fault-specific intelligence for ambiguous cases
* Single composite metric for straightforward ranking
* Physically interpretable degradation progression
