V52 METHODOLOGY: TACHOMETER-BASED FAULT FREQUENCY ANALYSIS
Technical Approach:


Adaptive Shaft Speed Measurement: Real-time computation of instantaneous shaft speed from tachometer zero-crossing timing
Precision Fault Frequency Targeting: Bearing fault frequencies calculated individually for each file based on measured shaft speed
Component-Specific Energy Extraction: Spectral energy analysis at inner race (BPFI) and outer race (BPFO) characteristic frequencies
Frequency Band Integration: Narrow-band energy summation around theoretical fault frequencies for defect signature detection
Monotonic Fault Energy Tracking: Health index derived from progressive increase in bearing fault frequency amplitudes


Physical Rationale:


Shaft Speed Variability Compensation: Tachometer-based measurement accounts for operational speed variations across test duration
Characteristic Frequency Precision: Exact fault frequency calculation ensures accurate targeting of bearing defect signatures
Defect Energy Amplification: Localized bearing damage produces distinct spectral peaks at mathematically predictable frequencies
Progressive Fault Severity: Energy at fault frequencies increases monotonically as bearing degradation advances from initiation to failure
Race-Specific Detection: Separate inner and outer race analysis captures location-dependent failure progression patterns


Results:


Shaft speed range: 105.0 to 105.6 Hz
Total fault energy range: 9.73e-04 to 5.89e-03 units
Inner race energy range: 4.68e-04 to 2.14e-03 units
Health Index range: 0.0736 to 0.8878


This tachometer-calibrated approach targets bearing-specific fault frequencies with operational speed precision for monotonic degradation tracking.
