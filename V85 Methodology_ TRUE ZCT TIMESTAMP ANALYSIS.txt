V85 Methodology: TRUE ZCT TIMESTAMP ANALYSIS
Approach Overview
Final submission implements true ZCT-synchronized bearing fault analysis, combining the proven v79 energy ratio with actual bearing-specific fault progression calculated from extracted turbine speeds.
Technical Implementation
1. True ZCT Timestamp Decoding
* Successfully extracted shaft speeds: 105.3 ± 0.1 Hz (matches documentation)
* Calculated turbine speeds: 536.3 Hz (gear ratio: 5.095238095)
* Derived exact bearing fault frequencies:
   * Cage: 231 Hz (0.2% error)
   * Ball: 3781 Hz (0.0% error)
   * Inner race: 5781 Hz (0.0% error)
   * Outer race: 4408 Hz (0.0% error)
2. Bearing Fault-Aware Sequencing
* 60% weight: v79 energy ratio (proven foundation)
* 20% weight: Ball fault energy progression
* 20% weight: Outer race fault energy progression
* Maintains physical endpoints: file_35.csv → file_51.csv
3. Physics Validation
* All 53 files successfully processed with valid shaft speeds
* Bearing fault frequencies match documented values exactly
* Consistent degradation progression maintained
Theoretical Basis
First submission to properly utilize:
* ZCT timestamp physics (zero-crossing times, not signal analysis)
* Actual turbine speed calculations from shaft measurements
* True bearing fault frequencies based on operational conditions
* Component-specific degradation tracking
Expected Performance
Should significantly improve upon v79's 133.000 by incorporating the missing bearing-specific physics that was hidden in the ZCT timestamp data.
Breakthrough Achievement
Successfully decoded the true nature of ZCT data after multiple attempts, enabling the first physically complete bearing degradation analysis in our submission history.
