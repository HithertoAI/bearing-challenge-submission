V44 METHODOLOGY: OPERATIONAL REGIME DETECTION ANALYSIS
Investigating bearing sequence through operational condition variations rather than pure degradation progression.


Technical Approach:
* Operational Intensity Assessment: RMS and peak vibration levels for load condition estimation
* Load Distribution Analysis: Vibration amplitude distribution ratios as mechanical load indicators
* Frequency Regime Identification: Spectral energy distribution across structural, meshing, and bearing frequency bands
* Operational Stability Metrics: Zero-crossing timing consistency and transient detection for operational smoothness


Physical Rationale:
* Load Condition Variations: Different operational loads create distinct vibration signatures and energy distributions
* Frequency Regime Shifts: Changing operational conditions excite different structural and contact frequency ranges
* Operational Stability: Mechanical condition affects rotational consistency and transient behavior
* Multi-Condition Sequencing: Bearing test sequence may represent progressive load steps or operational state changes


Results:
* Health Index range: 14.41 to 18.33 units
* RMS Vibration range: 24.30 to 50.41 units
* Load Indicator range: 26.19 to 31.63
* High-Frequency Ratio range: 0.0200 to 0.3216


This operational regime approach explores the possibility that the sequence represents varying test conditions rather than linear degradation progression.
