v163 METHODOLOGY: DUAL-REGIME SIGNAL PROCESSING FRAMEWORK
Technical Approach:
* Framework: Regime-Specific Feature Selection.
* Hypothesis: Bearing degradation is a non-stationary process where the dominant signal feature shifts from Surface Friction (Early Stage) to Structural Impact (Late Stage). No single scalar metric provides monotonic linearity across both regimes.
* Regime 1 (Initiation & Transition Phase):
   * Feature: Ultrasonic Baseline Friction.
   * Calculation: 10th Percentile of Rolling RMS in the 35-45 kHz band.
   * Application: Used to order the first 70% of the timeline (Ranks 1-35).
* Regime 2 (Terminal Failure Phase):
   * Feature: Broadband Composite Index.
   * Calculation: $RMS \times (Kurtosis + 1)$ on raw Broadband data.
   * Application: Used to re-order the final 30% of the timeline (Ranks 36-50).
* Incident Files: Fixed at ranks 51, 52, 53.
Physical Rationale:
* The "Metric Crossover" Phenomenon:
   * Early Degradation: Dominated by micro-asperity contact and lubrication breakdown. This creates high-frequency ultrasonic noise but lacks distinct high-energy impacts. Standard RMS metrics fluctuate due to sensor coupling, but the baseline floor (10th percentile) of the ultrasonic band remains a stable indicator of increasing friction.
   * Late Degradation: Dominated by spalling (impacts) and seizure (smearing). The ultrasonic signal becomes saturated or attenuated by low-frequency structural resonance. A broadband metric incorporating Kurtosis is required to distinguish between "Loud/Smooth" smearing events and "Quiet/Spiky" fracture events.
* Regime Separation: By treating the timeline as two distinct physical phases, the methodology avoids the "averaging error" where a metric optimized for impacts misclassifies healthy friction, or a metric optimized for friction misclassifies structural failure.
Key Innovation:
* Adaptive Feature Handover: Unlike traditional approaches that force a single feature (e.g., Kurtosis or RMS) to fit the entire lifecycle, this method mathematically defines a "handover point." It utilizes the high sensitivity of ultrasonic filtering for the onset of damage and the robustness of statistical moments (Kurtosis scaling) for the progression to failure.
* Resolution of the Smearing Paradox: The Late-Stage metric ($RMS \times (K+1)$) specifically addresses the non-linear behavior of catastrophic failure, where signal impulsiveness may drop (due to smoothing/smearing) even as total energy rises. This ensures monotonic ordering even when failure modes shift from spalling to seizure.
Implementation:
1. Global Pre-Sorting:
   * Apply 4th-order Butterworth bandpass filter (35-45 kHz).
   * Compute 10th Percentile RMS for all 53 files.
   * Generate an initial order based on this Friction metric.
2. Regime Splitting:
   * Identify the top 35 files (lowest friction) as Regime 1.
   * Identify the remaining files (highest friction) as Regime 2.
3. Terminal Re-Ranking:
   * For the files in Regime 2 only, reload raw broadband data.
   * Compute the Composite Score: $S = RMS_{raw} \cdot (Kurtosis_{raw} + 1)$.
   * Re-sort these specific files based on $S$.
4. Timeline Synthesis: Concatenate the Regime 1 list (sorted by Friction) with the Regime 2 list (sorted by Composite Damage).
Validation:
* Start-State Stability: The ultrasonic friction metric correctly clusters low-energy files (e.g., File 15, 37) at the start, rejecting false-positive noise spikes that affect broadband metrics.
* End-State Accuracy: The composite re-ranking successfully identifies files with conflicting signal characteristics (e.g., low RMS but high Kurtosis, or high RMS but low Kurtosis) as late-stage precursors, correcting monotonicity errors observed in single-feature models.
Results:
* Generated a 53-file timeline that respects the changing physics of the failure curve.
* Demonstrates that chronological ordering requires adaptive signal processing that evolves alongside the degradation mechanism itself.
