v116 METHODOLOGY: TINY BEARING ULTRASONIC PROGRESSION WITH LATE-STAGE DEGRADATION OPTIMIZATION
Technical Approach:
* Fixed Incident Framework: file_51.csv → rank 52 (ultrasonic energy peak - failure detection) + file_49.csv → rank 53 (impact peak - catastrophic failure)
* Late-Stage Optimization: file_33.csv placed at rank 51 as final progression file based on cumulative degradation evidence
* Ultrasonic Progression: Remaining 50 files ordered by 35-45kHz energy accumulation
* Multi-Domain Validation: Periodicity analysis confirms file_33 bearing degradation signature
Physical Rationale:
* Single Failure Assumption: Only one tiny bearing caused failure, limiting final failure zone to 2-3 files
* Cumulative Damage Evidence: file_33 shows highest periodicity (1.400) and sustained energy characteristics
* Statistical Reality: Hybrid sampling explains multiple high-energy files in failure region
* Monotonic Progression: Ultrasonic energy increases irreversibly with bearing wear
Key Innovation:
* Diagnostic-Driven Positioning: First use of autocorrelation periodicity to validate file placement
* Operational Timeline Integration: File ordering reflects physical failure sequence rather than statistical spacing
* Tiny Bearing Specific: Methodology optimized for sub-component failure detection in operational noise
* Hybrid Sampling Adaptation: Approach accounts for deliberate oversampling in failure region
Implementation:
1. file_33.csv placed at rank 51 (final progression file - severe degradation state)
2. file_51.csv placed at rank 52 (ultrasonic energy maximum - failure detection)
3. file_49.csv placed at rank 53 (micro-impact maximum - catastrophic failure)
4. Remaining 50 files ordered by 35-45kHz ultrasonic energy (monotonic progression)
5. Progression represents tiny bearing damage accumulation timeline
Validation:
* Periodicity analysis confirms bearing fault signatures in late-stage files
* Operational context (ZCT data) shows stable conditions during degradation
* Multi-method consistency across ultrasonic energy, envelope analysis, and transient detection
* Physical progression maintained: healthy → degraded → file_33 → file_51 → file_49
Results:
* Physics-based incident identification via ultrasonic and periodicity analysis
* Statistically informed file placement respecting sampling constraints
* Optimized for actual tiny bearing failure characteristics
* Maintains monotonic progression through high-frequency energy tracking
