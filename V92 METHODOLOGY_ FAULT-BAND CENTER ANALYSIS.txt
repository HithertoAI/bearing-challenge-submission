V92 METHODOLOGY: FAULT-BAND CENTER ANALYSIS
APPROACH:
Uses the provided fault-band centers [231, 3781, 5781, 4408] Hz as resonance frequencies where bearing faults manifest. Measures vibration energy around these frequencies to track bearing degradation.
PHYSICAL BASIS:
As bearings degrade, they create stronger impacts that excite structural resonances at these specific frequencies. Higher energy = more advanced degradation.
WHY THIS WORKS:
* Uses the exact frequencies provided in the challenge
* Based on established bearing fault physics (resonance excitation)
* Direct measurement of fault manifestation, not indirect inference
RESULTS:
Fault energy range: 2.48e+06 to 4.56e+06 (spread: 2.08e+06)
Healthiest: file_35 (energy: 2.48e+06)
Most degraded: file_30 (energy: 4.56e+06)
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Compute FFT of vibration data for each file
2. Sum energy in bands around each fault-band center (±25-50 Hz)
3. Order files by increasing total fault-band energy
4. Higher energy indicates more advanced bearing degradation
INNOVATION:
First approach to directly use the provided fault-band centers as resonance frequencies for chronological ordering, following established bearing fault detection methodology where developing faults excite structural resonances at characteristic frequencies.
Files ordered by increasing fault-band energy = chronological order from healthy to degraded bearing state.
