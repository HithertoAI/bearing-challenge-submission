V67 METHODOLOGY: PURE DEGRADATION ORDERING (ALL FILES EQUAL)
Technical Approach:
* Uniform Treatment Protocol: All 53 files processed identically without authenticity or operating condition discrimination
* Simplified Degradation Index: Three-component weighted metric (40% RMS vibration, 40% total bearing fault frequency energy, 20% statistical kurtosis)
* Bearing Fault Frequency Analysis: Energy summation across ±50 Hz bands centered on four critical frequencies (231, 3781, 5781, 4408 Hz)
* Direct Ranking: Single-pass ordering by ascending degradation index values (rank 1 = lowest degradation, rank 53 = highest degradation)
* Control Baseline Establishment: Ignores real/synthetic classification to test whether authenticity-based approaches provide measurable improvement
Physical Rationale:
* Occam's Razor Principle: Simplest hypothesis that bearing degradation is the sole ordering criterion, regardless of data source
* Classification Independence Test: Determines whether real/synthetic distinction is signal or noise in chronological reconstruction
* Pure Degradation Hypothesis: If challenge is fundamentally about bearing condition progression, authenticity may be irrelevant confounding variable
* Performance Floor Establishment: Provides baseline score against which more complex authenticity-aware approaches can be evaluated
* Feature Reduction: Tests whether eliminating operating condition and authenticity dimensions improves or degrades performance
Results:
* Degradation index range:  0.595 to 1.530
* Ordering strategy: Purely monotonic by composite degradation metric
* No group stratification or interleaving patterns applied
* Healthiest files assigned ranks 1-5, most degraded assigned ranks 49-53 based solely on degradation index
