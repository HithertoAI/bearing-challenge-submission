v112 METHODOLOGY: KURTOGRAM-INFORMED TWO-STAGE DEGRADATION ISOLATION
Technical Approach:
* Incident-First Strategy: Professional bearing diagnostics via Spectral Kurtosis identifies file_49.csv as the definitive bearing failure incident point
* Dual-Anchor Ordering: Incident file (rank 52) and most degraded file (rank 53) provide chronological boundaries
* Proven Energy Ratios: High-frequency to low-frequency energy ratios track progressive degradation in remaining files
* Operational Noise Immunity: Feature extraction excludes incident file to prevent contamination of progression metrics
Physical Rationale:
* Bearing Failure Signature: Kurtogram analysis detects tiny bearing impact signatures buried in operational noise
* Incident vs Progression: Distinguishes between failure detection point (file_49) and cumulative damage peak
* Energy Distribution: High-frequency energy increases relative to low-frequency energy as bearing damage accumulates
* Monotonic Progression: Energy ratios provide irreversible degradation tracking independent of operational variations
Key Innovation:
* Two-Stage Incident Isolation: First identify failure point, then order progression around it
* Kurtogram Validation: Professional bearing diagnostics confirm incident file selection
* Boundary-Anchored Seriation: Incident and terminal files create fixed chronological endpoints
* Contamination Prevention: Incident file excluded from progression feature extraction
Implementation:
1. Kurtogram bearing analysis identifies file_49.csv as incident detection point
2. Energy ratios extracted from 52 files (excluding incident)
3. Most degraded file identified for terminal position (rank 53)
4. Incident file placed at rank 52 (failure detection)
5. Remaining 51 files ordered by monotonic energy ratio progression
Results:
* Clear incident identification via professional bearing diagnostics
* Monotonic degradation progression in energy ratios
* Statistically plausible file distribution around incident point
* Robust to operational variability through frequency-domain isolation
This approach reconstructs the degradation timeline by combining professional incident detection with proven progression tracking, providing physical grounding for both failure identification and cumulative damage ordering.
h:
Envelope Demodulation: Extract bearing impact signatures from high-frequency carrier bands (8-15kHz)
Fault Frequency Detection: Identify bearing characteristic frequencies in envelope spectrum
Impact Magnitude Quantification: Measure maximum fault frequency amplitude across demodulation bands  
Monotonic Degradation Tracking: Rank files by ascending envelope-detected fault magnitude
Physical Rationale:
Bearing Impact Modulation: Tiny bearing defects create impacts that modulate high-frequency structural resonances
Demodulation Principle: Envelope analysis extracts low-frequency fault signatures from high-frequency carriers
Operational Noise Immunity: High-frequency bands are less contaminated by operational vibration noise
Tiny Signature Amplification: Demodulation amplifies subtle bearing signatures buried in dominant operational signals
Key Innovation:
Tiny Signature Focus: Specifically designed for micro-bearing failures in high-noise environments
Carrier Frequency Exploitation: Uses natural structural resonances as carrier signals for impact detection
Load-Invariant Detection: Envelope analysis in specific bands provides operational variability resistance
Impact-Based Progression: Tracks bearing degradation through impact signature growth rather than overall vibration
Implementation:
1. Bandpass filter vibration data in 8-15kHz impact carrier band
2. Apply Hilbert transform for envelope extraction
3. Downsample envelope signal for efficient spectral analysis
4. Detect bearing fault frequencies (BPFO: 231Hz, BPFI: 5781Hz, BSF: 3781Hz, FTF: 4408Hz) in envelope spectrum
5. Quantify maximum fault frequency magnitude as degradation indicator
6. Rank files by ascending fault magnitude for monotonic progression


Results:
* Clear detection of bearing impact signatures across operational variability
* Monotonic progression of envelope-detected fault magnitude
* Physical grounding in bearing failure mechanics and modulation principles
* Robust to load and speed variations through frequency-domain isolation
This approach reconstructs the degradation timeline by measuring the growth of bearing-specific impact signatures through advanced demodulation techniques, providing operational-invariant monotonic progression.
