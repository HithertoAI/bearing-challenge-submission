V110 METHODOLOGY: CUMULATIVE DAMAGE ACCUMULATION
Focusing on irreversible system property changes rather than instantaneous vibration states.


Technical Approach:
* Energy Distribution: Measures how vibration energy spreads across frequencies
* Stiffness Proxy: High-frequency to low-frequency energy ratio
* Persistent Nonlinearity: Skewness indicating irreversible system changes
* Energy Distribution Entropy: Measures disorder in vibration energy distribution
* Combined Cumulative Index: Weighted ensemble of irreversible damage indicators


Physical Rationale:
* Irreversible Changes: System properties only degrade, never improve
* Material State: Cumulative damage changes stiffness, damping, and nonlinear behavior
* Memory Effect: Systems "remember" previous damage through altered dynamics
* Building Process: Focuses on what accumulates across the entire timeline


Key Innovation:
* Accumulation Focus: First approach to explicitly measure what builds irreversibly
* System Properties: Tracks changes in fundamental mechanical characteristics
* Damage Memory: Captures how systems retain evidence of previous damage
* Timeline Reconstruction: Orders files by total accumulated damage to date


Results:
* Cumulative damage index showing monotonic progression
* Focus on irreversible building blocks of degradation
* Foundation for true prognostic health monitoring


This approach reconstructs the damage timeline by measuring irreversible system property changes that accumulate regardless of operational cycles.
