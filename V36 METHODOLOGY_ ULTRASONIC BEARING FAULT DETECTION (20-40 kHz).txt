V36 METHODOLOGY: ULTRASONIC BEARING FAULT DETECTION (20-40 kHz)
Building on our foundational vibration analysis, V36 introduces ultrasonic frequency band monitoring to detect early-stage bearing faults that manifest in high-frequency emissions before they appear in lower frequency vibrations.
Key Innovation:
* Focuses on ultrasonic frequency range (20-40 kHz) for early fault detection
* Captures high-frequency stress waves from bearing surface interactions
* Provides sensitivity to incipient faults missed by conventional vibration analysis
* Enables proactive maintenance through early warning signatures
Technical Approach:
* Primary analysis: Ultrasonic energy in 20-40 kHz band
* Signal processing: Band-pass filtering and energy computation
* Feature extraction: Root Mean Square (RMS) of ultrasonic signals
* Output: Normalized ultrasonic energy metrics across dataset
Physical Rationale:
* Ultrasonic emissions: Generated by micro-impacts and friction in early bearing faults
* High-frequency focus: Insulates fault signatures from lower-frequency machinery noise
* Early detection: Identifies faults at initial stages before significant degradation occurs
* Complementary: Works alongside traditional vibration analysis for comprehensive monitoring
Results:
* Energy range: 5398.285392 to 19347.435078
* Comprehensive coverage across all test channels
* Provides sensitive indicator of early-stage bearing deterioration
This V36 approach extends our monitoring capability into the ultrasonic spectrum, delivering enhanced sensitivity to incipient bearing faults for improved prognostic accuracy.
