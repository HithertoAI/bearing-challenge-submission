V90 METHODOLOGY: ENERGY CONCENTRATION ANALYSIS
PHYSICAL APPROACH:
Measures energy concentration in the top 1% of envelope spectrum frequencies.
As bearings degrade, fault impacts create concentrated energy at specific
frequencies in the envelope spectrum.
PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:
* Healthy bearing: Energy evenly distributed (low concentration ~0.026)
* Degraded bearing: Energy concentrated at fault frequencies (high concentration ~0.071)
WHY THIS WORKS BETTER THAN GINI:
The energy concentration metric directly measures what we care about - how
much vibration energy is concentrated at bearing fault frequencies versus
being evenly distributed.
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Hilbert transform to extract signal envelope
2. FFT on envelope to obtain envelope spectrum
3. Calculate energy concentration in top 1% of frequency bins
4. Sort files by increasing energy concentration
RESULTS:
Concentration range: 0.0261 to 0.0711 (spread: 0.0450)
Healthiest: file_51 (Conc: 0.0261)
Most degraded: file_47 (Conc: 0.0711)
INNOVATION:
Direct physical measurement of bearing degradation through energy distribution
in envelope spectrum, bypassing complex statistical indices. This approach
follows established bearing fault physics where developing faults create
periodic impacts that amplitude-modulate the vibration signal, resulting in
concentrated energy at specific frequencies in the envelope spectrum.
