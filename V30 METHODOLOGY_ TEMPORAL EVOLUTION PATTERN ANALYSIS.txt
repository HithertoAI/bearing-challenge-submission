V30 METHODOLOGY: TEMPORAL EVOLUTION PATTERN ANALYSIS


APPROACH:
Dynamic analysis of bearing degradation through temporal progression patterns within each recording.


CORE INNOVATION:
- Temporal trend analysis within files
- Multi-feature degradation scoring
- Mini-timeline simulation
- Progression-sensitive metrics


TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Segment vibration signals into 10 temporal windows
2. Calculate energy progression trend using linear regression
3. Combine RMS, Kurtosis, Crest Factor, and trend slope
4. Compute weighted degradation score
5. Sort by comprehensive score ascending


VALIDATION:
- Score Range: 47.5 to 17,780.5
- Dynamic Range: 374x
- Healthiest: file_28.csv
- Most Degraded: file_52.csv


STRATEGIC POSITION:
Evolutionary pattern analysis provides superior degradation tracking over static feature approaches.
