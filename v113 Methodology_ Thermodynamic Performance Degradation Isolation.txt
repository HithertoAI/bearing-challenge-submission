v113 Methodology: Thermodynamic Performance Degradation Isolation
Technical Approach:
* Incident-First Strategy: Kurtogram bearing analysis identifies file_49.csv as failure detection point
* Thermodynamic Degradation Tracking: ZCT timing patterns as engine performance efficiency proxy
* Friction Loss Accumulation: Bearing damage → increased mechanical friction → timing variations → efficiency loss
* Multi-Feature Fusion: Timing consistency, power delivery efficiency, operational stability, mechanical loss metrics
Physical Rationale:
* Bearing-Wear Efficiency Link: Damaged bearings increase friction, reducing mechanical efficiency
* Timing Variation Signature: Efficiency loss manifests as increased timing jitter in ZCT data
* Irreversible Degradation: Mechanical friction losses accumulate monotonically
* Operational Signal Extraction: Timing variations become primary degradation indicator
Key Innovation:
* Novel Modality: First use of ZCT timing as primary degradation signal
* Thermodynamic Proxy: Mechanical efficiency as health indicator
* Friction-Based Model: Physical bearing wear to efficiency loss correlation
* Noise-to-Signal Conversion: Operational variations become degradation metrics
Implementation:
1. Kurtogram bearing diagnostics confirm file_49.csv as incident
2. Thermodynamic efficiency analysis on 52 files excluding incident
3. Multi-feature health scoring based on timing pattern degradation
4. Most inefficient file identified as terminal point (rank 53)
5. Incident file placed at failure detection (rank 52)
6. Remaining files ordered by thermodynamic health progression
Results:
* Professional incident detection via bearing diagnostics
* Novel thermodynamic degradation progression tracking
* Physical efficiency loss model for monotonic ordering
* Complete modality shift from vibration to timing analysis
