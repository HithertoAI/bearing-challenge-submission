V103 Methodology: 3 Phase Cluster Temporal Reconstruction
Approach Description:
Our methodology employs a cluster-based temporal reconstruction strategy with proper signal alignment. We first synchronized vibration and tachometer data using the aligned 2-second window, then calculated physically meaningful features including vibration RMS energy, kurtosis, and instantaneous angular speed variation derived from zero-crossing timing data. Files were clustered into healthy, transition, and incident groups based on combined degradation signatures.
Rationale for Feature Choice:
We selected vibration RMS energy for within-cluster ordering due to its proven monotonic relationship with accumulated mechanical wear. Instantaneous angular speed variation from properly aligned ZCT data provided crucial torsional dynamics information. The combined incident score incorporated both structural vibration energy and rotational instability metrics, capturing the multifaceted nature of turboshaft degradation physics.
Technical Details:
The analysis properly utilized the first 212 ZCT points (2-second aligned window) to calculate instantaneous angular speed and its variation. Vibration features were extracted from the synchronized 2-second acceleration data. Cluster assignment was determined by a weighted combination of vibration energy, impulsiveness (kurtosis), and rotational stability metrics. Final chronological ordering maintained the physical progression from healthy operation through gradual degradation to terminal incident.
Innovation Statement:
Our approach innovates by rigorously maintaining proper temporal alignment between vibration and tachometer data, enabling physically meaningful feature extraction. By combining structural vibration metrics with torsional dynamics from Instantaneous Angular Speed analysis, we capture both the energy dissipation and rotational instability pathways of mechanical degradation. The cluster-based framework effectively handles sparse random sampling while respecting the irreversible physics of cumulative damage.
