V3 METHODOLOGY: SPECTRAL KURTOSIS APPROACH


This submission uses spectral kurtosis to detect bearing degradation through impulsive impact patterns rather than overall vibration energy.


Key Innovation:
- Focuses on kurtosis of power spectral density (impulsive content)
- Detects bearing impacts and early-stage faults
- Completely different ranking than RMS or fault energy methods


Technical Approach:
- Calculated spectral kurtosis from vibration data
- Files ranked by kurtosis values (range: 26 to 2640)
- Assumes bearing impacts increase monotonically with degradation


Rationale:
Spectral kurtosis excels at detecting transient impacts characteristic of bearing faults, potentially capturing early degradation stages missed by energy-based methods.


This represents a paradigm shift from energy monitoring to impact pattern analysis.
