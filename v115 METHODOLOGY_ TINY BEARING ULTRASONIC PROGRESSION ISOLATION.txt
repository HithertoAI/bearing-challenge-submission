v115 METHODOLOGY: TINY BEARING ULTRASONIC PROGRESSION ISOLATION
Technical Approach:
* Dual-Incident Strategy: file_51.csv (ultrasonic energy peak) + file_49.csv (impact count peak)
* Ultrasonic Progression: Files 1-51 ordered by 35-45kHz energy accumulation
* Tiny Bearing Physics: High-frequency energy indicates micro-bearing damage progression
* Monotonic Tracking: Ultrasonic energy increases irreversibly with bearing wear
Physical Rationale:
* Micro-Bearing Signatures: Tiny components emit ultrasonic vibrations when damaged
* Energy Accumulation: Bearing damage accumulates as increased ultrasonic energy
* Failure Progression: Energy peak → impact peak represents failure sequence
* High-Frequency Isolation: 35-45kHz band specific to tiny bearing natural frequencies
Key Innovation:
* Ultrasonic Progression Metric: First use of high-frequency energy as monotonic health indicator
* Dual-Incident Timeline: Separates energy peak (failure) from impact peak (catastrophic)
* Tiny Bearing Specific: Methodology optimized for sub-component failure detection
* Physical Energy Tracking: Direct measurement of damage accumulation in relevant frequency band
Implementation:
1. file_51.csv placed at rank 52 (ultrasonic energy maximum - failure detection)
2. file_49.csv placed at rank 53 (micro-impact maximum - catastrophic failure)
3. Remaining 51 files ordered by 35-45kHz ultrasonic energy (monotonic progression)
4. Progression represents tiny bearing damage accumulation timeline
Results:
* Physics-based incident identification via ultrasonic analysis
* Monotonic progression through high-frequency energy tracking
* Optimized for actual tiny bearing failure characteristics
* Final submission leveraging day's analytical insights
