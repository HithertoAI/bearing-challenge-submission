V49 METHODOLOGY: ENSEMBLE FEATURE PROGRESSION ANALYSIS


Technical Approach:
* Multi-Domain Feature Fusion: Combined analysis of time-domain, frequency-domain, and signal complexity characteristics
* Statistical Progression Indicators: RMS, kurtosis, and crest factor measurements for degradation tracking
* Broadband Spectral Analysis: Energy distribution across low-frequency (100-1000 Hz), mid-frequency (1000-5000 Hz), and high-frequency (5000-15000 Hz) bands
* Signal Complexity Metrics: Information entropy and zero-crossing rate for signal randomness assessment
* Spectral Shape Characterization: Spectral centroid and spread for frequency distribution analysis


Physical Rationale:
* Multi-Stage Degradation: Different failure stages manifest through distinct combinations of signal properties
* Impact Progression: Increasing kurtosis and crest factor indicate developing localized defects and impacts
* Energy Migration: Shifting spectral centroid reveals changing dominant vibration mechanisms
* Complexity Evolution: Entropy changes reflect transition from periodic to chaotic vibration patterns
* Broadband Signatures: Overall energy increases capture general degradation severity


Results:
* Health Index range: 36.69 to 49.92 units
* RMS Vibration range: 24.30 to 50.41 units
* Kurtosis range: -0.56 to 0.04
* Crest Factor range: 3.69 to 5.08


This ensemble approach captures bearing degradation progression through complementary feature evolution across multiple signal domains.
