V75 Methodology: Spectral Decomposition
Approach Overview
V75 employs spectral decomposition to extract physically meaningful features that evolve monotonically with bearing degradation, combining multiple frequency-domain indicators into a unified degradation score.
Technical Implementation
1. Spectral Feature Extraction
* Computed Fast Fourier Transform for each vibration signal
* Analyzed positive frequency components only (0-46.875 kHz)
* Extracted three key degradation indicators:
High-to-Low Frequency Energy Ratio
   * Low-frequency band: 10-1000 Hz (structural vibrations)
   * High-frequency band: 5000-20000 Hz (bearing impacts and faults)
   * Ratio increases as degradation shifts energy to higher frequencies
   * Spectral Spread
   * Measures dispersion of spectral energy around centroid
   * Increases as degradation creates broader frequency content
   * Frequency-Domain Kurtosis
   * Measures impulsiveness in frequency distribution
   * Increases with bearing fault development
2. Degradation Score Computation
   * Combined features using weighted linear combination:
   * Energy ratio: 40% weight
   * Spectral spread: 30% weight
   * Frequency kurtosis: 30% weight
   * Normalized features implicitly through ratio-based measures
3. Monotonic Sequencing
   * Sorted files by computed degradation scores from lowest to highest
   * Assigned ranks 1-53 based on score progression
   * Identified natural degradation trajectory without complex optimization
Theoretical Basis
Bearing degradation follows predictable spectral evolution patterns:
   * Early stage: Dominated by low-frequency structural vibrations
   * Mid stage: Emergence of high-frequency bearing fault components
   * Late stage: Broadband impacts and chaotic frequency content
The combined degradation score captures this progression through physically interpretable spectral measures.
Output Format
Submission provides degradation ranks in correct format:
      * Row 2: Rank of file_01.csv
      * Row 3: Rank of file_02.csv
      * Continuing through all 53 files with ranks 1-53
Key Advantages
      * Physically grounded in bearing degradation mechanics
      * Computationally efficient with O(n) complexity
      * Combines multiple complementary spectral indicators
      * Naturally handles unidirectional degradation progression
      * Provides interpretable degradation scores with clear physical meaning
