V80 METHODOLOGY: complementary feature combination

 Approach Overview
V80 builds upon the breakthrough energy ratio discovery by fusing it with the second-most predictive feature, spectral centroid, creating a complementary feature combination that captures both energy redistribution and frequency shift aspects of bearing degradation.
Technical Implementation
1. Dual-Feature Extraction
* Energy Ratio: High-to-low frequency energy ratio (5000+ Hz / 0-1000 Hz)
   * Range: 220.0 to 585.1 (2.66× spread)
   * Captures energy migration from structural vibrations to fault impacts
* Spectral Centroid: Weighted mean frequency of vibration spectrum
   * Range: 27,790 Hz to 33,238 Hz
   * Captures overall frequency shift toward higher bands with degradation
2. Feature Fusion Strategy
* Normalized both features to [0,1] range for equal weighting
* Applied weighted combination:
   * Energy ratio: 60% weight (primary, near-perfect monotonicity)
   * Spectral centroid: 40% weight (complementary frequency information)
* Created unified degradation score through linear fusion
3. Optimized Ranking
* Sorted files by fused degradation score
* Assigned ranks 1-53 based on combined feature progression
* Maintained physical consistency with v79's endpoints
Theoretical Basis
The feature combination captures complementary degradation mechanisms:
* Energy ratio: Tracks the fundamental shift from low-frequency dominance (healthy) to high-frequency dominance (degraded)
* Spectral centroid: Monitors the upward migration of vibrational energy across the frequency spectrum
* Fusion benefit: Corrects potential local ranking errors where single features might be ambiguous
Key Advantages
* Leverages the near-perfect energy ratio (0.998 monotonicity)
* Adds complementary frequency shift information
* Robust to local feature ambiguities
* Maintains physical interpretability
* Builds upon proven v79 foundation
Expected Performance
This enhanced approach should maintain v79's strong performance while potentially correcting minor ranking errors, potentially closing the 7-point gap to reach or exceed the current leader's 126.000 score.
Validation
Consistent identification of file_35.csv as healthiest and file_51.csv as most degraded provides confidence in the physical plausibility of the progression.
