V8 METHODOLOGY: SEISMIC-STYLE BEARING ANALYSIS


Approaching bearing degradation through the lens of seismic wave propagation and acoustic resonance patterns.


Key Innovation:
- Treats bearing faults as "acoustic earthquakes" with wave propagation characteristics
- Uses STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform) for time-frequency analysis
- Analyzes frequency-dependent energy attenuation patterns
- Measures energy dispersion entropy across frequency bands


Technical Approach:
- Primary analysis: STFT with 1024-sample segments at 25.6kHz sampling
- Frequency bands: Low (<1kHz), Medium (1-5kHz), High (>5kHz)
- Attenuation ratio: Low-frequency energy / High-frequency energy
- Energy entropy: Dispersion metric across frequency spectrum
- Combined score: Attenuation ratio × Energy entropy


Physical Rationale:
- Low-frequency persistence: Damaged bearings show sustained low-frequency energy (like seismic surface waves)
- High-frequency attenuation: Early fault signatures appear in high frequencies but attenuate quickly
- Energy dispersion: Degradation changes how vibration energy distributes across frequencies
- Wave propagation: Bearing structure acts as acoustic medium with fault-dependent transmission


Results:
- Attenuation ratio range: 0.07 to 0.17 (consistent low-frequency dominance)
- Energy entropy range: 5.40 to 5.80 (moderate dispersion variation)


This represents a fundamental shift from time-domain feature extraction to wave physics-based analysis of bearing degradation progression.
