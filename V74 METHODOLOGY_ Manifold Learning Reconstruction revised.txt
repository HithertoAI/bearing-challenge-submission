V74 METHODOLOGY: Manifold Learning Reconstruction revised
Approach Overview
V74 employs manifold learning to discover the intrinsic one-dimensional degradation trajectory through high-dimensional feature space, ranking files from healthiest to most degraded based on their position along the discovered manifold.
Technical Implementation
1. Multi-Domain Feature Extraction
* Computed 12 diverse features across temporal, spectral, and statistical domains:
   * Temporal statistics: mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis
   * Amplitude characteristics: 95th percentile, absolute 95th percentile
   * Spectral energy distribution: low-frequency (0-1kHz), mid-frequency (1-5kHz), high-frequency (5kHz+) bands
   * Spectral properties: dominant frequency bin, dominant magnitude, spectral entropy
2. Nonlinear Manifold Learning
* Standardized all features to zero mean and unit variance
* Applied t-SNE dimensionality reduction with 1-dimensional target space
* Used perplexity=15 to balance local and global structure preservation
* Discovered intrinsic manifold coordinates representing degradation progression
3. Degradation Ranking
* Sorted files by manifold coordinates from lowest to highest values
* Assigned ranks 1-53 based on manifold position
* Identified file_05.csv as healthiest state (rank 1)
* Identified file_17.csv as most degraded state (rank 53)
Theoretical Basis
Bearing degradation evolves continuously through a complex, high-dimensional feature space. The underlying degradation trajectory forms a smooth 1D manifold that can be discovered through nonlinear dimensionality reduction, where position along the manifold corresponds to degradation severity.
Output Format
Submission provides degradation ranks for each file in original order:
* Row 2: 40 (file_01.csv is 40th healthiest)
* Row 3: 21 (file_02.csv is 21st healthiest)
* Continuing through all 53 files with ranks 1-53
Key Advantages
* Captures nonlinear degradation patterns through manifold learning
* Combines information from multiple feature domains
* Provides natural handling of unidirectional degradation progression
* Discovers intrinsic data structure without predefined degradation models
