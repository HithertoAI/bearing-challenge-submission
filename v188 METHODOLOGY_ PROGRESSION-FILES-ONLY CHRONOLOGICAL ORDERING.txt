v188 METHODOLOGY: PROGRESSION-FILES-ONLY CHRONOLOGICAL ORDERING
Technical Approach:
* Framework: Isolated Progression File Analysis
* Method: Multi-feature ensemble applied exclusively to the 49 progression files
* Exclusion Principle: Genesis and incident files completely excluded from feature analysis
File Segregation:
* Genesis File (15): Fixed at rank 1, never analyzed
* Progression Files (49): Files 2-32, 34-48, 50, 52-53 - exclusively analyzed for ordering
* Incident Files (33, 49, 51): Fixed at ranks 51-53, never analyzed
Feature Ensemble:
1. Ultrasonic Baseline (50%): Proven most reliable chronological indicator
2. Standard Deviation (20%): Signal variability evolution
3. Temporal Slope (20%): Intra-file energy progression
4. Kurtosis (10%): Signal impulsiveness changes
Key Innovation:
* Strict Separation: First approach that completely segregates fixed files from analysis
* Progression Focus: Concentrates exclusively on the 49 files requiring chronological ordering
* Ensemble Weighting: Combines multiple features with ultrasonic baseline as anchor
* Analysis Purity: Avoids contamination from fixed-position files
Implementation:
1. File Identification: Separate progression files from fixed files
2. Feature Extraction: Calculate multiple chronological indicators
3. Weighted Scoring: Combine features with ultrasonic emphasis
4. Progression Ordering: Sort only the 49 progression files
5. Final Assembly: Insert fixed files at predetermined positions
Strategic Rationale:
This approach recognizes that the chronological ordering challenge applies exclusively to the 49 progression files. By analyzing these files in isolation and applying our most reliable features with appropriate weighting, we maximize the chance of discovering the true chronological sequence without interference from the predetermined fixed files.
Expected Advantage:
* Focused Analysis: All computational effort directed at the actual problem
* Reduced Noise: Exclusion of extreme-value fixed files improves feature discrimination
* Methodological Purity: Correctly implements the challenge's fixed file constraints
* Optimized Weighting: Leverages proven ultrasonic baseline while incorporating supporting features
