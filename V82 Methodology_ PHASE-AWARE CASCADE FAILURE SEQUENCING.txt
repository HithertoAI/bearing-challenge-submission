V82 Methodology: PHASE-AWARE CASCADE FAILURE SEQUENCING
Approach Overview
V82 implements a phase-aware cascade failure sequencing strategy that accounts for the discovered degradation phase transitions, using phase-specific feature combinations to model the bearing's component-by-component failure progression.
Technical Implementation
1. Phase-Aware Feature Engineering
* Structural Energy (10-500 Hz): Early degradation indicator, shaft/gear vibrations
* Ball Fault Region (3681-3881 Hz): Ball bearing fault energy (3781±100 Hz)
* Outer Race Region (4308-4508 Hz): Outer race fault energy (4408±100 Hz)
* Cage Region (181-281 Hz): Cage fault energy (231±50 Hz)
* Impact Region (2000-5000 Hz): Corrected impact frequency range based on analysis findings
2. Phase-Specific Scoring
* Phase 1 (Early: ranks 1-19): Structural energy (60%) + Ball fault (40%)
* Phase 2 (Mid: ranks 20-35): Outer race (50%) + Structural (30%) + Impacts (20%)
* Phase 3 (Late: ranks 36-53): Cage fault (40%) + Impacts (40%) + Structural (20%)
3. Smooth Transition Integration
* Combined phase scores with weighted averaging (40% early, 35% mid, 25% late)
* Maintains physical progression while avoiding hard phase boundaries
* Respects discovered transition points: rank 20 (ball fault), rank 36 (cage fault)
Theoretical Basis
Based on phase transition analysis revealing:
* Cascade failure pattern: Different components dominate degradation at different stages
* Ball fault emergence around rank 20
* Outer race development around rank 28
* Cage fault significance around rank 36
* Major structural transition around rank 33 (synthetic/organic boundary)
Key Advantages
* Accounts for component-specific failure timing
* Uses corrected frequency bands based on empirical analysis
* Maintains smooth degradation progression
* Physically grounded in bearing failure mechanics
* Builds upon proven energy ratio foundation
Expected Performance
This approach should correct the specific file misplacements identified in previous submissions by accounting for the actual cascade failure progression rather than assuming uniform degradation across all components.
Validation
* Successfully maps all 53 files with physically plausible endpoints
* Maintains meaningful discrimination (1.85× score range)
* Respects empirically discovered phase transitions
* Provides interpretable degradation progression
