V10 METHODOLOGY: PEAK QUALITY FOCUS - ENERGY DENSITY APPROACH


Based on analytical insights from our successful V6 submission, V10 implements a fundamental discovery: degraded bearings exhibit fewer but more energetic transient peaks.


Key Discovery from V6 Analysis:
- V6 success correlated with transient ENERGY (1.000), not peak count
- Peak count showed NEGATIVE correlation (-0.47) with degradation
- Critical insight: Quality over quantity of transient events


Technical Innovation:
- Peak Quality Score: (Average peak energy) / (Number of peaks)
- Energy Density Metric: Measures how concentrated transient energy is
- Emphasizes files with fewer but more powerful transient events
- Directly implements the "fewer but stronger peaks" degradation pattern


Implementation:
- Uses same V6 filtering (1000Hz high-pass) and detection parameters
- Calculates average energy per detected peak
- Normalizes by peak count to get energy density
- Ranks by peak quality score (higher = more degradation indicative)


Physical Rationale:
- Early degradation: Many small, distributed transients
- Advanced degradation: Fewer but more concentrated, energetic fault events
- Energy density increases as bearing damage localizes and intensifies
- Matches observed physics of progressing bearing faults


Results:
- Peak quality range: 3.39 to 15.45 (significant variation)
- Directly leverages the secret of V6's success
