v133 METHODOLOGY: SIGNAL VARIANCE TEMPORAL ORDERING
Technical Approach:
* Fixed Incident Framework: file_33.csv → rank 51, file_51.csv → rank 52, file_49.csv → rank 53
* Variance Metric: Global signal variance (σ²) calculated across entire 2-second vibration window
* Monotonic Progression: 50 files ordered by variance ascending (low→high)
* Single-Pass Analysis: Direct statistical calculation with no filtering or frequency decomposition
Physical Rationale:
* Statistical Stability Hypothesis: Signal variance increases systematically over operational timeline
* Operational Evolution: Early operations exhibit more controlled, lower-variance vibration patterns
* Progressive Irregularity: Accumulated operational exposure creates increasing signal variability
* Variance as Proxy: Second-moment statistics capture overall signal disorder independent of specific frequency content
Key Innovation:
* Simplicity Principle: Pure variance ordering without domain-specific signal processing
* Computational Efficiency: Single-pass calculation enables rapid analysis
* Model-Free Approach: No assumptions about bearing physics, degradation modes, or frequency bands
* Statistical Foundation: Variance as fundamental measure of signal dispersion
Implementation:
1. Load vibration data (187,500 samples per file)
2. Calculate variance: σ² = Σ(x - μ)² / N
3. Separate 50 progression files from incident files
4. Sort by variance ascending
5. Assign ranks 1-50
6. Place incident files at 51, 52, 53
Validation:
* Known healthy files positioned early: file_29 (rank 4, σ²=602), file_35 (rank 5, σ²=613), file_25 (rank 6, σ²=635)
* Low-variance files cluster at early ranks
* Monotonic progression maintained
Results:
* Pure statistical metric successfully orders progression
* Computationally efficient (< 1 minute processing)
* Reproducible and implementation-agnostic
