V59 METHODOLOGY: ENVELOPE SPECTRUM BEARING FREQUENCY PEAK ANALYSIS
Technical Approach:


Band-Pass Filtering: 2-8 kHz filter isolation of bearing resonance frequency band
Hilbert Transform Demodulation: Envelope extraction from filtered high-frequency carrier signal
Envelope Spectrum Computation: FFT analysis of demodulated envelope signal to reveal modulation frequencies
Bearing Frequency Peak Detection: Amplitude measurement at theoretical bearing fault frequencies (cage, ball, inner race, outer race)
Noise Floor Normalization: Peak prominence calculation relative to median spectrum baseline
Energy Band Concentration: Ratio analysis of bearing frequency band energy to total envelope energy
Harmonic Analysis: Detection of 2× and 3× inner race frequency harmonics indicating advanced degradation
Multi-Feature Degradation Score: Weighted combination of peak heights, prominences, energy ratios, and harmonic evidence


Physical Rationale:


Kurtosis Limitation Addressed: Time-domain impulsiveness metrics fail when faults produce continuous rather than discrete impacts
Frequency Domain Fault Localization: Bearing defects modulate high-frequency resonances at characteristic fault frequencies regardless of signal distribution shape
Envelope Demodulation: Lifts low-energy repetitive fault signals from high-frequency noise and masking vibration
Peak Emergence Progression: Healthy bearings show flat noise floor; degraded bearings exhibit distinct peaks at BPFO/BPFI with increasing amplitude
Component-Specific Diagnosis: Peak locations identify exact failing element (inner race, outer race, rolling element, cage)
Monotonic Energy Increase: Bearing frequency band energy grows progressively as fault severity advances from initiation through failure
