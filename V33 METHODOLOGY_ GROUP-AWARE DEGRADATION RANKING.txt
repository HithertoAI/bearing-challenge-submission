V33 METHODOLOGY: GROUP-AWARE DEGRADATION RANKING


1. RMS-BASED CLUSTERING:
   - Identified 6 natural operational regimes via RMS energy analysis
   - Groups represent distinct operating conditions with internal degradation
   - RMS ranges: Group1(24-26), Group2(27-28), Group3(28-30), Group4(30-32), Group5(32-38), Group6(38-50)


2. WITHIN-GROUP RANKING:
   - Used dominant frequency (smoothest progressing feature) for intra-group ordering
   - Dominant frequency increases systematically within each operational regime
   - Combines the benefits of discrete operational modes with continuous degradation tracking


3. PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:
   - Lower RMS groups represent healthier operating conditions
   - Higher dominant frequency indicates advanced component wear within each regime
   - Respects the natural structure of the data rather than forcing continuous progression


VALIDATION:
- Based on comprehensive file relationship analysis
- Uses the feature with smoothest progression (dominant frequency)
- Maintains physical plausibility across operational boundaries
