V46 METHODOLOGY: DIRECT NOMINAL FREQUENCY ANALYSIS
Utilizing provided bearing fault frequencies directly for vibration energy assessment, bypassing speed measurement inconsistencies.


Technical Approach:
* Provided Frequency Utilization: Direct analysis at specified bearing fault frequencies [231, 3781, 5781, 4408] Hz
* Wideband Energy Capture: ±5% frequency bands around each nominal fault frequency
* Total Bearing Energy: Summed vibration energy across all four characteristic bearing frequencies
* Simple Health Metric: Direct energy measurement without speed-dependent calculations


Physical Rationale:
* Bearing-Specific Frequencies: Provided frequencies represent characteristic fault modes (cage, ball, inner race, outer race)
* Energy Progression: Increasing vibration energy at fault frequencies indicates advancing bearing degradation
* Measurement Independence: Avoids potential errors in rotational speed measurement or shaft identification


Results:
* Health Index range: 0.485 to 1.453 units
* Successful energy detection at all four provided bearing frequencies
* Clear discrimination between file vibration characteristics


This approach leverages provided engineering parameters directly to establish bearing health progression.
