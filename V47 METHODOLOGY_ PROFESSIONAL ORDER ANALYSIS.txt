V47 METHODOLOGY: PROFESSIONAL ORDER ANALYSIS
Implementing industry-standard order tracking techniques to reveal bearing degradation patterns invisible to traditional frequency analysis.


Technical Approach:
* Tachometer-Based RPM Extraction: Zero-crossing timing data used as pseudo-tachometer for precise rotational speed tracking
* Order Spectrum Calculation: Vibration analysis in rotational order domain rather than frequency domain
* Bearing Order Energy: Vibration energy at characteristic bearing orders [0.43x, 7.05x, 10.78x, 8.22x] of rotational speed
* Synchronized Analysis: Vibration data aligned with rotational phase for order tracking


Physical Rationale:
* Rotational Synchronization: Order analysis aligns vibration with mechanical rotation, eliminating speed variation effects
* Cage-Dominated Signature: Order analysis reveals cage fault energy that traditional frequency analysis obscures
* True Bearing Signature: Order domain provides clearer separation of bearing component vibrations
* Professional Methodology: Industry-standard approach used in rotating machinery diagnostics


Results:
* Health Index range: 5.69 to 9.46 units
* Total Order Energy range: 5.69 to 9.46 units  
* Cage Order Energy range: 3.99 to 7.29 units


This professional order analysis approach uncovers bearing degradation signatures that traditional frequency-domain methods cannot detect.
