v175 METHODOLOGY: MULTI-SCALE DAMAGE ACCUMULATION RATE FRAMEWORK


Technical Approach:
* Framework: Multi-Scale Exponential Growth Analysis.
* Hypothesis: Bearing degradation compounds multiplicatively across frequency scales as failure progresses. The rate of damage accumulation, not just damage amount, reveals the true chronological sequence.
* Core Innovation: Damage Accumulation Rate (DAR) - measures how quickly failure modes amplify across wavelet scales.
* Feature: Multi-Scale Exponential Compounding.
  * Calculation: Product of exponential growth rates across wavelet detail coefficients.
  * Formula: DAR = ∏(1 + g_i) × (1 + E_imb) where g_i are growth rates per scale, E_imb is energy imbalance.
  * Application: Single metric applied to all middle files (ranks 2-50).


Physical Rationale:
* The "Scale-to-Scale Amplification" Phenomenon:
  * Early Degradation: Isolated frequency components show minimal growth. Energy remains balanced across scales.
  * Progressive Failure: Damage begins transferring between scales - high-frequency components excite lower-frequency resonances.
  * Terminal Phase: Exponential growth emerges simultaneously across multiple scales as the system loses stability.
* Multiplicative vs Additive Compounding:
  * Traditional approaches sum features additively, missing the compounding nature of mechanical failure.
  * This method models damage multiplication: failure in one frequency band accelerates failure in others.


Key Innovation:
* Exponential Growth Detection: Unlike static energy measurements, this approach fits exponential curves to wavelet coefficients over time, capturing the acceleration of degradation.
* Cross-Scale Coupling: The product term ∏(1 + g_i) mathematically represents how failure modes amplify each other across frequency domains.
* Energy Redistribution Tracking: The energy imbalance term E_imb detects when the system begins transferring energy between scales - a precursor to cascade failure.


Implementation:
1. Multi-Scale Decomposition:
   * Apply 5-level wavelet decomposition (Daubechies-4) to vibration data.
   * Extract detail coefficients for scales 1-5.
2. Exponential Growth Analysis:
   * For each detail coefficient series, fit exponential growth model: y = a·e^(b·t)
   * Extract growth rate parameter b for each scale.
3. Damage Accumulation Computation:
   * Compute multiplicative compounding: compounded_growth = ∏(1 + |b_i|)
   * Calculate energy imbalance: E_imb = σ(energies) / μ(energies)
   * Final DAR = compounded_growth × (1 + E_imb)
4. Timeline Construction:
   * Fixed anchors: file_15 (rank 1), incident files (ranks 51-53).
   * Middle files ranked by ascending DAR (lower accumulation = earlier).


Validation:
* Physical Consistency: The method naturally clusters files with balanced energy distribution and minimal cross-scale growth at the timeline start.
* Failure Progression: Files showing simultaneous exponential growth across multiple scales are correctly positioned later in the sequence.
* Anchor Respect: The framework maintains physical constraints while applying innovative analysis to the uncertain middle segment.


Results:
* Generates a physically plausible timeline where damage progression follows observable multi-scale dynamics.
* Demonstrates that chronological ordering requires modeling how failure compounds across the system's frequency architecture, not just measuring current damage state.
