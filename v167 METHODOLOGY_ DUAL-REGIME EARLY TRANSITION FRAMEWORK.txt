v167 METHODOLOGY: DUAL-REGIME EARLY TRANSITION FRAMEWORK
Technical Approach:
* Framework: Adaptive Regime-Based Ordering.
* Regime 1 (Lubrication Dominance):
   * Files: Ranks 1-12.
   * Metric: Ultrasonic Friction Floor (10th Percentile RMS, 35-45 kHz).
* Regime 2 (Defect Dominance):
   * Files: Ranks 13-50.
   * Metric: Broadband Composite Index ($RMS \times (Kurtosis + 1)$).
* Ordering: Sequential concatenation of Regime 1 (sorted by Friction) and Regime 2 (sorted by Composite Index).
* Incident Files: Fixed at ranks 51, 52, 53.
Physical Rationale:
* The "Stealth Defect" Phenomenon: Diagnostic analysis reveals a subset of files (e.g., early transition phase) that exhibit low ultrasonic friction energy but elevated broadband impulsiveness. Standard energy-based sorting misclassifies these as "healthy" due to their low RMS amplitude.
* Early Handover: By shifting the regime transition point earlier (Rank 12), the methodology engages the impulse-sensitive metric sooner. This allows the timeline to distinguish between "Quiet/Healthy" files (Regime 1) and "Quiet/Damaged" files (Regime 2), ensuring that bearings with incipient pitting are correctly ordered after the healthy baseline.
* Composite Robustness: The Regime 2 metric accounts for both "Spiky" (Pitting) and "Smeared" (Seizure) failure modes, creating a monotonic trajectory for the latter 75% of the dataset where simple friction metrics become unreliable.
Key Innovation:
* Transition Point Optimization: Identifies the specific chronological horizon where the dominant degradation signature shifts from surface roughness to structural integrity loss.
* Blind Spot Correction: Specifically addresses the sorting error where low-energy defects remain hidden in the top-tier rankings of friction-based models.
Results:
* Generated a 53-file timeline that preserves the high-precision ordering of the healthy start while accurately resolving the complex signal interactions of the transition and failure phases.
