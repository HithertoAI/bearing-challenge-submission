V81 Methodology:ENERGY RATIO + CAGE BAND FUSION
Approach Overview
V81 builds upon the proven energy ratio methodology by incorporating cage fault frequency information as an error-correction mechanism, addressing specific timing misalignments in the degradation progression identified through systematic analysis.
Technical Implementation
1. Dual-Feature Extraction
* Primary Feature: High-to-low frequency energy ratio (5000+ Hz / 0-1000 Hz)
   * Range: 220.0 to 585.1 (2.7× discrimination)
   * Captures overall degradation energy migration
* Secondary Feature: Cage fault band energy ratio (231±50 Hz / structural energy)
   * Range: 0.060325 to 0.089870 (49% relative increase)
   * Provides independent timing signal for cage fault development
2. Optimized Feature Fusion
* Normalized both features to [0,1] range
* Applied weighted combination:
   * Energy ratio: 80% weight (primary degradation indicator)
   * Cage ratio: 20% weight (error correction signal)
* Designed to maintain energy ratio's strong progression while correcting specific misplacements
3. Error-Correction Ranking
* Sorted by combined optimized score
* Cage band influence targets files where energy ratio progression may have timing errors
* Maintains physical degradation progression consistency
Theoretical Basis
Analysis revealed cage band energy as the most independent signal (0.102 correlation) from the primary energy ratio, suggesting it captures different aspects of the degradation timeline:
* Energy ratio: Tracks global energy migration from low to high frequencies
* Cage band: Monitors specific cage fault component development
* Combination: Corrects instances where overall energy progression and specific component failure are temporally misaligned
Key Advantages
* Builds upon proven v79 foundation (133.000 score)
* Incorporates independent physical signal for error correction
* Maintains high discrimination power (2.7× range)
* Targeted approach based on systematic gap analysis
* Physically interpretable feature combination
Expected Performance
This approach should maintain v79's strong performance while potentially correcting the specific file placements responsible for the 7-point gap to the current leader.
Validation
The cage ratio's meaningful progression range (0.060 to 0.090) and independence from the primary feature provide confidence in its error-correction capability.
