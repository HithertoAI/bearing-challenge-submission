V12 METHODOLOGY: COMBINED RMS + FAULT ENERGY


Hybrid approach combining proven RMS vibration with targeted fault frequency energy.


APPROACH:
- RMS: Overall vibration energy (continuous wear indicator)
- Fault Energy: Energy in known BPFO/BPFI/BSF/FTF frequency bands
- Combined Score: RMS + scaled fault energy
- Ranks files by increasing combined degradation score


RATIONALE:
- RMS alone may miss early-stage fault signatures
- Fault energy alone may be too sensitive to operational variations  
- Combined approach provides robustness: captures both general wear and specific fault development
- Weighted combination balances the two indicators


PHYSICAL BASIS:
Uses actual system parameters: 93,750 Hz sample rate, known fault frequencies
