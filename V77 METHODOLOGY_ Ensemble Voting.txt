V77 METHODOLOGY: Ensemble Voting
 Approach Overview
V77 employs ensemble voting to combine rankings from three proven degradation assessment methodologies, leveraging the "wisdom of crowds" principle to create a more robust and accurate chronological sequence.
Technical Implementation
1. Multi-Method Feature Extraction
Implemented three distinct degradation scoring approaches:
V18 Methodology
* RMS vibration level
* Signal kurtosis
* Crest factor
* High-to-low frequency energy ratio (5000-20000 Hz / 10-1000 Hz)
* Combined using empirically validated weights
V15 Methodology
* RMS vibration level
* Standard deviation
* Mean absolute value
* Simple additive combination
V37 Methodology
* RMS vibration level with enhanced weighting
* Standard deviation with reduced weighting
* Scaled combination for different sensitivity
2. Rank Aggregation
* Computed individual rankings for each methodology
* Calculated average rank across all three approaches
* Sorted files by consensus average rank
* Assigned final ranks 1-53 based on ensemble agreement
Theoretical Basis
Ensemble methods improve prediction accuracy by:
* Reducing variance from individual method limitations
* Mitigating overfitting to specific data characteristics
* Leveraging complementary strengths of different approaches
* Providing more stable rankings through consensus
Output Format
Submission provides ensemble-optimized degradation ranks:
* Row 2: Rank of file_01.csv
* Row 3: Rank of file_02.csv
* Continuing through all 53 files with ranks 1-53
Key Advantages
* Builds upon proven successful methodologies
* Reduces reliance on any single feature or approach
* Naturally handles methodological uncertainties
* Provides robust ranking through consensus
* Scalable to incorporate additional successful approaches
Expected Performance
This ensemble approach should outperform individual methods by leveraging complementary degradation indicators and reducing the impact of any single methodology's limitations or biases.
