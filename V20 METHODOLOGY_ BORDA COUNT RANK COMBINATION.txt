V20 METHODOLOGY: BORDA COUNT RANK COMBINATION
APPROACH:
Robust rank-based feature combination using Borda count method. Each file is ranked for each feature, and ranks are summed to create a consensus degradation sequence.
CORE METHOD:
* Feature Ranking: Each of 53 files ranked 1-53 for RMS, Kurtosis, Crest Factor, and Energy Ratio
* Borda Count: Sum of ranks across all four features for each file
* Consensus Sequencing: Files sorted by ascending Borda score (lowest = healthiest, highest = most degraded)
FEATURES USED:
1. RMS (overall vibration energy)
2. Kurtosis (signal impulsiveness)
3. Crest Factor (peak-to-RMS ratio)
4. Energy Ratio (high/low frequency energy distribution)
ADVANTAGES:
* Extremely Robust: Handles non-monotonic features gracefully
* Scale-Invariant: No normalization required - uses ranks only
* Consensus-Based: Multiple features contribute equally to final sequence
* Proven Method: Standard approach for ranking problems without ground truth
RESULTS:
* Borda Score Range: 27 to 202 (good separation across 53 files)
* Equal Weighting: All features contribute equally to final ranking
* Stable Output: Avoids numerical instability of multiplicative methods
