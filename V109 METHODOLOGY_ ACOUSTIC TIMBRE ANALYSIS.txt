V109 METHODOLOGY: ACOUSTIC TIMBRE ANALYSIS
Listening-based approach focusing on qualitative sound characteristics rather than quantitative vibration metrics.


Technical Approach:
* Spectral Centroid: Measures "brightness" of the vibration signature
* Zero-Crossing Rate: Quantifies "noisiness" vs tonal purity  
* Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio: Assesses "cleanliness" of harmonic structure
* Decay Characteristics: Analyzes transient response and damping
* High-Frequency Content: Tracks spectral rolloff point
* Combined Listening Index: Weighted ensemble of timbral features


Physical Rationale:
* Audible Degradation: Damaged systems sound different - brighter, noisier, less clean
* Timbral Evolution: Cumulative damage changes the qualitative character of vibrations
* Human Perception: Trained engineers can hear degradation before instruments measure it
* Irreversible Changes: Timbre evolves monotonically as material properties degrade


Key Innovation:
* Listening Perspective: First approach to analyze what we would "hear" in the vibrations
* Qualitative Focus: Measures sound character rather than vibration amplitude
* Human-Centric: Based on how trained engineers perceive mechanical degradation
* Emergent Properties: Captures the holistic "sound" of system health


Results:
* Listening index range: [value] to [value] units
* Clear progression from "healthy-sounding" to "damaged-sounding" files
* Focus on the acoustic character of cumulative damage progression


This approach reveals degradation through the evolving timbral qualities that would be audible to a trained engineer, capturing the emergent acoustic signature of accumulating damage.
