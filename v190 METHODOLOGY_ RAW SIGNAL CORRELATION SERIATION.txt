v190 METHODOLOGY: RAW SIGNAL CORRELATION SERIATION


================================================================================
THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
================================================================================


This approach abandons domain-specific feature extraction in favor of a 
first-principles assumption: temporally adjacent samples from a continuous 
physical process should exhibit maximum mutual similarity. Rather than 
imposing assumptions about degradation signatures, operational regimes, or 
spectral evolution, we allow the raw signal structure to define proximity.


================================================================================
PHYSICAL BASIS
================================================================================


The helicopter turboshaft vibration signal represents the superposition of 
multiple rotating components, structural resonances, and stochastic processes. 
While the instantaneous amplitude varies with operational state, the underlying 
signal morphology—the pattern of peaks, valleys, and phase relationships—evolves 
gradually over time.


Files extracted from nearby temporal positions share:
- Similar operational context
- Correlated phase relationships between harmonic components  
- Common structural resonance patterns
- Equivalent background noise characteristics


This similarity degrades monotonically with temporal separation.

METHODOLOGY
================================================================================


1. SIGNAL NORMALIZATION
   - Load complete vibration signal (187,500 samples) for each file
   - Zero-mean and unit-variance normalization
   - Removes amplitude bias while preserving waveform structure


2. PAIRWISE SIMILARITY COMPUTATION
   - Pearson correlation coefficient between all file pairs
   - Correlation computed on representative sample (10,000 points)
   - Yields 49×49 similarity matrix for middle files


3. DISTANCE TRANSFORMATION
   - Convert similarity to distance: D(i,j) = 1 - ρ(i,j)
   - Higher correlation → lower distance → temporal proximity


4. ANCHOR-SEEDED PATH CONSTRUCTION
   - Identify file most correlated with anchor (file_15)
   - Greedy nearest-neighbor traversal from seed point
   - Each step selects unvisited file with minimum distance


5. LOCAL OPTIMIZATION
   - 2-opt refinement to eliminate path crossings
   - Iterative improvement until no beneficial swaps remain


6. RANKING ASSIGNMENT
   - Anchor file_15 → Rank 1
   - Ordered middle files → Ranks 2-50
   - Incident files 33, 51, 49 → Ranks 51, 52, 53


================================================================================
MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION
================================================================================


For normalized signals x_i and x_j:


    ρ(i,j) = Σ(x_i · x_j) / (n-1)


Distance matrix:


    D(i,j) = 1 - ρ(i,j)


Objective: Find permutation π minimizing total path length:


    L(π) = Σ D(π_k, π_{k+1})


================================================================================
INNOVATION CLAIM
================================================================================


This framework demonstrates that chronological ordering can emerge from 
signal-level similarity without explicit feature engineering. The approach 
is domain-agnostic—applicable to any sequential process where temporal 
adjacency implies structural similarity.


By treating the ordering problem as graph optimization rather than feature 
ranking, we avoid assumptions about which signal characteristics encode 
temporal information. The data speaks for itself.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
================================================================================


- Sample size: 10,000 points (computational efficiency)
- Optimization: Greedy TSP + 2-opt (4 improvement iterations)
- Complexity: O(n² log n) for n files
- Reproducibility: Deterministic given fixed random seed
