V13 METHODOLOGY: CEPSTRUM HARMONIC ANALYSIS


Detects bearing fault progression through harmonic pattern analysis in the cepstral domain.


APPROACH:
- Computes real cepstrum (inverse FFT of log power spectrum)
- Identifies peaks at quefrencies corresponding to known fault frequencies
- Uses maximum cepstral peak strength as degradation indicator
- Ranks files by increasing harmonic pattern strength


RATIONALE:
- Bearing faults create characteristic harmonic families in vibration spectra
- Cepstrum excels at detecting these periodic harmonic patterns
- Harmonic strength should increase with bearing degradation
- More robust to noise than direct spectral analysis


PHYSICAL PARAMETERS:
Sample Rate: 93,750 Hz
Fault Frequencies: BPFO=4408Hz, BPFI=5781Hz, BSF=3781Hz, FTF=231Hz


TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Real cepstrum computed via: cepstrum = |IFFT(log(|FFT(signal)|))|
- Quefrency analysis windows: ±20% around expected fault frequencies
- Feature: Maximum cepstral peak strength across all fault bands
