V23 METHODOLOGY: SYSTEMATIC CREST FACTOR REMOVAL TEST
APPROACH:
Controlled experiment to determine the value of Crest Factor in our feature set. Direct comparison against V18's winning approach with one feature removed.
CORE HYPOTHESIS:
Crest Factor may be adding noise rather than signal due to its known non-monotonic behavior in bearing degradation.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
* V18 (Control): RMS + Kurtosis + Crest Factor + Energy Ratio (4 features)
* V23 (Test): RMS + Kurtosis + Energy Ratio (3 features - Crest Factor removed)
* All other factors identical: Same normalization, same weighting, same features
FEATURES RETAINED:
1. RMS: Fundamental degradation energy indicator
2. Kurtosis: Signal impulsiveness measure
3. Energy Ratio: High-performance feature with 4.29x dynamic range
FEATURE REMOVED:
* Crest Factor: Peak-to-RMS ratio (potentially non-monotonic)
VALIDATION METRICS:
* Health Index Range: 0.4861 to 2.2979
* Dynamic Range: 4.73× (comparable to V18)
* Feature Count: Reduced from 4 to 3
SCIENTIFIC VALUE:
Regardless of score outcome, this submission provides critical data about feature importance for future optimization.
