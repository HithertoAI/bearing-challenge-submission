v147 METHODOLOGY: UNSUPERVISED SPECTRAL MANIFOLD LEARNING
Technical Approach:
* Core Algorithm: Isomap (Isometric Mapping) for non-linear dimensionality reduction.
* Feature Input: High-resolution Power Spectral Density (PSD) vectors.
   * Frequency Band: 35-45 kHz (Ultrasonic domain).
   * Resolution: 2048 spectral bins (Welch's method).
* Manifold Construction:
   * Nearest Neighbors ($k=6$): Establishes local connectivity between spectrally similar files.
   * Geodesic Distance: Calculates distance along the curved surface of the data structure rather than direct Euclidean distance.
* Timeline Extraction: Projects the high-dimensional spectral changes onto a single "degradation coordinate" (Component 1).
* Orientation: Directionality resolved via correlation with total energy (positive correlation confirms degradation direction).
* Incident Files: Fixed at ranks 51, 52, 53.
Physical Rationale:
* The Manifold Hypothesis: Bearing degradation does not follow a straight line in feature space. It follows a complex, curved path (a manifold) as micro-geometry changes.
* Topological Order: Standard methods (RMS/Kurtosis) measure magnitude. Isomap measures evolution. It determines that File A is close to File B because their spectra are locally similar, reconstructing the timeline based on signal topology.
* Spectral Fingerprinting: By using the full 35-45 kHz spectrum as a coordinate, the method captures shifts in resonance and sidebands that scalar metrics miss.
Key Innovation:
* Unsupervised Reconstruction: Removes human bias regarding which files are assumed to be healthy.
* Geodesic Metric: Application of non-Euclidean distance to order the dataset based on structural similarity.
* Spectral Evolution Tracking: Prioritizes the "shape" of the frequency change over simple amplitude growth.
Implementation:
1. Data Ingestion: Load all 50 non-incident files (excluding files 33, 49, 51)2.
2. Feature Extraction:
   * Compute PSD using Welch’s method (nperseg=2048).
   * Isolate 35-45 kHz band to eliminate low-frequency mechanical noise.
   * Log-transform PSD ($log_{10}$) to normalize dynamic range.
3. Manifold Learning:
   * Standardize features (Z-score) to weight all frequency bins equally.
   * Fit Isomap: n_neighbors=6, n_components=1.
   * Extract the embedding coordinate for each file.
4. Timeline Orientation:
   * Calculate correlation between Manifold Coordinate and Total Energy.
   * If correlation < 0, flip coordinate sign to align with entropy increase.
5. Ranking:
   * Sort files by Manifold Coordinate (ascending).
   * Append Incident Files (33, 51, 49) at ranks 51-533.
Validation:
* Structure Discovery: Manifold correlation with energy is 0.5534. This indicates the method has found a consistent timeline structure that is distinct from simple energy growth.
* Start Point Identification: Identifies File 37 and File 16 as the initiation point of the timeline.
* Healthy File Analysis:
   * File 35 is positioned at Rank 5.
   * File 25 and File 29 are identified as mid-stage degradation files based on spectral topology, diverging from standard energy assumptions.
Theoretical Basis:
* Degradation is a continuous temporal process.
* Adjacent files in time must be neighbors in the spectral feature space.
* By minimizing the sum of geodesic distances, the true chronological sequence is reconstructed even if the energy fluctuates non-monotonically.
Results:
* Successfully generated a 53-file timeline based on spectral topology.
* Methodology prioritizes "smoothness of spectral evolution" over "loudness of signal."
* Provides a purely data-driven ordering that operates independently of scalar threshold assumptions.
