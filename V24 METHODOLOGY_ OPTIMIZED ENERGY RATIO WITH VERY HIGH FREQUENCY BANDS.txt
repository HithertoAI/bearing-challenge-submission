V24 METHODOLOGY: OPTIMIZED ENERGY RATIO WITH VERY HIGH FREQUENCY BANDS
APPROACH:
Data-driven optimization of Energy Ratio frequency bands based on systematic offline analysis. Maintains V18's proven structure while implementing empirically superior frequency ranges.
CORE OPTIMIZATION:
* Previous (V18): High band: 5-20 kHz, Low band: 10-1000 Hz
* Optimized (V24): High band: 10-30 kHz, Low band: 100-5000 Hz
ANALYSIS BASIS:
* Systematic Testing: 5 frequency band configurations analyzed offline
* Performance Metric: Dynamic range of Energy Ratio across files
* Winner: "Very High Frequency" configuration with 7.09x dynamic range (3× improvement over V18's 2.39x)
PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:
* 10-30 kHz Band: Captures ultra-high frequency impacts and resonances from severe bearing damage
* 100-5000 Hz Band: Represents broader low-mid frequency operational energy
* Enhanced Contrast: Better separation between healthy and degraded states
FEATURE SET:
* RMS (overall energy)
* Kurtosis (impulsiveness)
* Crest Factor (peak-to-RMS)
* Optimized Energy Ratio (very high vs low-mid frequency energy)
VALIDATION:
* Health Index Range: 0.8890 to 2.8544
* Dynamic Range: 3.21× (composite)
* Energy Ratio Range: 0.17 to 1.97 (11.6× individual range)
STRATEGIC POSITION:
First submission using empirically optimized parameters from systematic offline analysis rather than trial-and-error submissions.
