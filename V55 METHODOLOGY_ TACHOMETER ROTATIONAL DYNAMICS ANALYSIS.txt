V55 METHODOLOGY: TACHOMETER ROTATIONAL DYNAMICS ANALYSIS
Technical Approach:
* Inter-Pulse Interval Statistics: Coefficient of variation analysis of tachometer zero-crossing timing for rotational consistency assessment
* Timing Jitter Quantification: Second-order temporal variations capturing micro-scale rotational irregularities
* Speed Modulation Spectral Analysis: FFT-based detection of cyclic speed variations indicating load fluctuation patterns
* Rotational Acceleration Variance: Derivative-based measurement of instantaneous speed change irregularity
* Signal Quality Degradation: Outlier detection and pulse dropout analysis for mechanical system integrity assessment
* Rotational Entropy Measurement: Information-theoretic quantification of interval distribution predictability
* Multi-Domain Dynamics Integration: Weighted combination of temporal, spectral, and statistical rotational features
Physical Rationale:
* Bearing-Induced Friction Variations: Degraded bearings create non-uniform rotational resistance affecting speed consistency
* Cyclic Load Modulation: Localized defects produce periodic load variations detectable in speed fluctuations
* Mechanical System Coupling: Tachometer captures integrated system response to bearing mechanical degradation
* Signal Integrity Degradation: Mechanical irregularities from bearing damage affect sensor signal quality
* Rotational Unpredictability: Progressive damage increases system complexity measurable through timing entropy
* Direct Mechanical Sensing: Tachometer signal encodes rotational dynamics independent of vibration frequency analysis
Results:
* Speed stability (CV): 0.000142 to 0.001657
* Timing jitter: 0.000045 to 0.000092
* Speed modulation: 29.99 to 3150.96 (primary discriminator)
* Acceleration variance: 0.000017 to 0.000051
* Signal quality degradation: 0.000000 to 0.007561
* Cyclic irregularity (entropy): 2.5262 to 2.8999
* Health Index range: 0.0764 to 0.7722
This tachometer-focused approach analyzes the rotational dynamics signal that previous methods have largely ignored, with speed modulation providing the primary degradation signature.
