V32 METHODOLOGY: BEARING DEGRADATION STAGE ANALYSIS


1. FREQUENCY BAND ANALYSIS:
   - Early Stage Damage: 250-2500 Hz bandpass filter
   - Advanced Stage Damage: 10,000-24,000 Hz bandpass filter
   
2. PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:
   - Early Stage: Localized component damage characterized by surface imperfections
   - Advanced Stage: Widespread component failure with significant material degradation
   - Health Score = Advanced Stage RMS - Early Stage RMS
   
3. RANKING LOGIC:
   - Lower health scores indicate healthier components (less advanced damage)
   - Higher health scores indicate more degraded components (advanced failure progression)
   
4. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
   - 4th order Butterworth bandpass filters
   - Root Mean Square (RMS) energy calculation in each frequency band
   - All 53 files processed consistently with same methodology


VALIDATION:
- All components show Advanced Stage > Early Stage, indicating progressive damage present
- Consistent results across multiple analysis runs
- Physically plausible health score distribution
