V34 METHODOLOGY: DOMINANT FREQUENCY DEGRADATION TRACKING


1. FEATURE SELECTION:
   - Dominant frequency identified as the feature with smoothest progression
   - Shows systematic evolution from low to high frequencies
   - Cleanest degradation signature in the dataset


2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Power Spectral Density analysis via Welch's method
   - Identification of dominant frequency component
   - Ranking by increasing frequency values (4463 Hz to 45284 Hz)


3. PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:
   - Healthiest operation: Lower dominant frequencies (~4-5 kHz)
   - Most degraded operation: Higher dominant frequencies (~45 kHz)
   - Systematic frequency shift indicates mechanical property changes


KEY INSIGHTS:
- Completely different timeline from vibration energy-based approaches
- File 14 transitions from "most degraded" to "healthiest" 
- Suggests fundamental frequency shifts are the true degradation signal
- Challenges previous assumptions about vibration energy progression
