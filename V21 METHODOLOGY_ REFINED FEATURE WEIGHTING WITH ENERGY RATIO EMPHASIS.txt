* V21 METHODOLOGY: REFINED FEATURE WEIGHTING WITH ENERGY RATIO EMPHASIS


APPROACH:
Strategic refinement of V18's winning approach by emphasizing the most discriminative feature (Energy Ratio) based on empirical performance analysis.
CORE INNOVATION:
*     Evidence-Based Weighting: Energy Ratio weight increased from 0.25 to 0.8 (3.2× emphasis)
*     Noise Reduction: Kurtosis and Crest Factor weights reduced from 0.25 to 0.3 each
*     Balanced Contribution: RMS maintains strong presence at 0.6 weight

WEIGHTING STRATEGY:
   *     Energy Ratio: 0.8 - Emphasized due to 4.29× dynamic range in V18
   *     RMS: 0.6 - Maintained as fundamental degradation indicator
   *     Kurtosis: 0.3 - Reduced due to potential non-monotonic behavior
   *     Crest Factor: 0.3 - Reduced due to noise sensitivity

PHYSICAL JUSTIFICATION:
      *     Energy Ratio captures the critical shift from low-frequency to high-frequency    energy dominance
      *     RMS provides the essential overall energy growth baseline
      *     Reduced weights for Kurtosis/Crest minimize impact of their known non-monotonic  characteristics

RESULTS:
         *     Health Index Range: 0.3023 to 1.5058
         *     Dynamic Range: 4.98× (improved from V18's composite range)
         *     Feature Balance: Energy Ratio contributes ~40% of total weight
STRATEGIC POSITION:
         * Builds directly on V18's proven success while implementing data-driven weight optimization to close the 8-point gap to 2nd place.
