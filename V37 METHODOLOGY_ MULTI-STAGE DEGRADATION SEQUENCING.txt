V37 METHODOLOGY: MULTI-STAGE DEGRADATION SEQUENCING
Building on bearing failure progression research, V37 introduces a stage-aware degradation model that addresses the non-linear progression of bearing failures through distinct physical regimes rather than treating degradation as a single continuous process.
Key Innovation:
* Implements three separate detectors for distinct bearing degradation stages
* Uses hierarchical scoring to prioritize failure stage over severity within stage
* Addresses the core sequencing problem by recognizing bearings in different failure regimes
* Moves beyond single-metric health indices to stage-specific physical signatures
Technical Approach:
* Stage 1 (Incipient): 20-40 kHz ultrasonic bandpass filter + RMS energy (subsurface fatigue)
* Stage 2 (Developing): 500-2000 Hz resonant bandpass filter + kurtosis (surface-breaking cracks)
* Stage 3 (Advanced): Envelope analysis + 1-5 kHz bearing frequency energy (established spalling)
* Hierarchical Combination: Health Index = (Stage3 × 10,000) + (Stage2 × 100) + Stage1
Physical Rationale:
* Stage 1: Captures ultrasonic emissions from microscopic subsurface cracking
* Stage 2: Detects resonant frequency excitation as cracks propagate to surface
* Stage 3: Identifies characteristic bearing frequencies through demodulation for advanced faults
* Hierarchical Logic: Ensures any Stage 3 fault ranks higher than any Stage 2 fault, regardless of severity
Results:
* Health Index range: 70.2M to 303.4M units
* Stage 1 (Ultrasonic) range: 7.62 to 28.97 units
* Stage 2 (Resonant Kurtosis) range: 2.84 to 79.18 units
* Stage 3 (Bearing Energy) range: 7,023 to 30,338 units
* Successfully distinguishes bearings across different degradation regimes
This V37 approach directly addresses the bearing degradation sequence problem by recognizing that failure progression occurs through distinct physical stages with different vibrational signatures, enabling correct sequencing across the entire degradation timeline.
