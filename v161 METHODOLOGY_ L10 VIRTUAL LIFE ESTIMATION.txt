v161 METHODOLOGY: L10 VIRTUAL LIFE ESTIMATION
Technical Approach:
* Metric: Estimated Remaining Useful Life ($RUL \propto L_{10}$).
* Formula: $L_{10} \propto \frac{1}{(P_{virt})^3}$.
* Virtual Load ($P_{virt}$): $RMS_{Ultrasonic} \times (1 + Kurtosis_{Broadband})$.
* Ordering: Descending Life (Highest $L_{10}$ $\to$ Lowest $L_{10}$).
* Incident Files: Fixed at ranks 51, 52, 53.
Physical Rationale:
* The Cubic Law: Standard bearing life theory (ISO 281) dictates that the fatigue life ($L_{10}$) of a ball bearing is inversely proportional to the cube of the dynamic load ($L \propto P^{-3}$). This provides a physics-based scaling factor for the "accelerating" nature of degradation (the "Sawtooth" effect), replacing arbitrary exponential curve-fitting with established tribological laws.
* Virtual Load Definition: Since dynamic load cannot be measured directly in this dataset, a "Virtual Load" ($P_{virt}$) is derived by fusing the two dominant degradation signatures:
   * Friction Term: Ultrasonic RMS (35-45 kHz) captures the base load from surface roughness/smearing.
   * Impact Term: Broadband Kurtosis captures the shock load from defect impacts (pitting).
   * Synthesis: By multiplying these terms, the model ensures that the Effective Load ($P$) increases regardless of whether the failure mode is dominated by Friction (Smearing) or Impacts (Spalling).
Key Innovation:
* Physics-Informed Feature Engineering: Instead of training a "black box" sorting algorithm, this method transforms the raw signal features into the Time Domain using the fundamental physical relationship governing rolling contact fatigue.
* Virtual Sensor Reconstruction: demonstrates a novel method for reconstructing the Dynamic Load variable from vibration data alone, allowing for the application of standard RUL formulas in sensor-limited environments.
Validation:
* Endpoint Resolution: The Cubic transformation ($x^{-3}$) expands the separation between late-stage files, clearly identifying File 08, File 14, and File 24 as the terminal pre-failure states (Ranks 48-50).
* Anomaly Correction: Successfully orders File 09 (Rank 44) as a late-stage defect, correcting previous energy-based models that misclassified it as healthy due to its low RMS amplitude.
