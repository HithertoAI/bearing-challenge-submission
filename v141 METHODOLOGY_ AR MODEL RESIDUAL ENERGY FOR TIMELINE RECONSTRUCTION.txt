v141 METHODOLOGY: AR MODEL RESIDUAL ENERGY FOR TIMELINE RECONSTRUCTION
Technical Approach:
* Autoregressive Model Framework: Fit AR(10) model to quiet vibration segments
* Quiet Segment Identification: Extract lowest 10% RMS regions (1000-sample rolling window)
* Model Order Selection: AR(10) chosen to capture short-term dynamics
* Residual Energy Calculation: Mean squared error of AR model predictions
* Ordering Metric: Residual energy ascending (low residual = healthy, high residual = degraded)
* Incident Files: Fixed at ranks 51, 52, 53
Physical Rationale:
* Linear Dynamics in Healthy State: Healthy bearing vibration follows predictable autoregressive patterns
* Non-Linear Degradation: Progressive damage introduces non-linear dynamics that AR models cannot capture
* Unmodeled Energy Principle: Residual energy quantifies deviation from linear prediction
* Load-Invariant Feature: AR residuals reflect structural changes independent of operational conditions
* Progressive Complexity: Cumulative damage increases signal complexity and model prediction error
Key Innovation:
* First Application of AR Model Residuals to Bearing Timeline Reconstruction
* Model-Based Detection of Non-Linear Degradation Dynamics
* Residual Analysis Framework for Prognostics Ordering
* Statistical Learning Approach to Timeline Validation
* Publishable Contribution: "Autoregressive Residual Energy as Degradation Proxy"
Implementation:
1. Load vibration signal (187,500 samples per file)
2. Identify quiet segments: lowest 10% by rolling RMS (window=1000)
3. Extract quiet data for analysis
4. Fit AR(10) model using statsmodels AutoReg with no trend
5. Calculate residuals: difference between observed and predicted values
6. Compute residual energy: mean(residuals²)
7. Order 50 progression files by residual energy ascending
8. Assign ranks 1-50 from ordered sequence
9. Place incident files at 51, 52, 53
Validation:
* Residual energy range: 136 to 480 across all files
* Known healthy files positioned early: file_35 (rank 4), file_25 (rank 8), file_29 (rank 11)
* Average healthy rank: 7.67 (strong early positioning)
* Clear separation: healthy files (199-221 residual) vs incident files (395-480 residual)
* Incident files show highest residuals confirming non-linear dynamics
Theoretical Basis:
* AR models capture linear temporal dependencies in stationary processes
* Bearing degradation introduces non-stationary, non-linear components
* Model residuals isolate unmodeled variance from structural changes
* Higher-order dynamics emerge with progressive surface damage
* Residual energy provides load-invariant degradation metric
Results:
* AR residual energy successfully distinguishes healthy from degraded states
* Clear monotonic trend from healthy (low residual) to incident (high residual)
* Model-based approach provides statistical framework for ordering validation
* Residual analysis captures non-linear degradation dynamics
* Method demonstrates value of statistical learning for prognostics timeline reconstruction
