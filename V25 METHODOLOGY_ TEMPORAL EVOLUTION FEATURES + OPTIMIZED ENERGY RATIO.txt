V25 METHODOLOGY: TEMPORAL EVOLUTION FEATURES + OPTIMIZED ENERGY RATIO
APPROACH:
Augments V24's optimized energy ratio with temporal evolution features to capture signal non-stationarity. Builds on the proven V18/V24 structure while introducing dynamic signal behavior analysis.
CORE INNOVATION:
* Temporal Evolution Features: Capture how signal statistics change over time within each acquisition
* RMS Volatility: Standard deviation of RMS across signal segments (measures energy fluctuation)
* Kurtosis Instability: Standard deviation of kurtosis across signal segments (measures impulsiveness variation)
PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:
* Non-Stationarity Detection: As bearings degrade, signals become less stationary with intermittent impacts
* RMS Volatility: Increasing energy fluctuations indicate unstable degradation patterns
* Kurtosis Instability: Varying impulsiveness suggests irregular impact events
* Complementary to Static Features: Captures dynamic behavior missed by whole-file statistics
FEATURE SET:
* RMS (overall energy)
* Kurtosis (impulsiveness)
* Crest Factor (peak-to-RMS)
* Optimized Energy Ratio (10-30 kHz vs 100-5000 Hz energy)
* RMS Volatility (temporal energy fluctuation)
* Kurtosis Instability (temporal impulsiveness variation)
VALIDATION:
* Health Index Range: 1.4578 to 4.1090
* Dynamic Range: 2.82× (composite)
* RMS Volatility Range: 1.07 to 4.28 (4.0× individual range)
* Kurtosis Instability Range: 0.097 to 0.256 (2.6× individual range)
STRATEGIC POSITION:
First submission incorporating temporal signal evolution to detect non-stationary degradation patterns, addressing the limitation of static feature analysis while maintaining V24's optimized frequency bands.
The temporal features show promise - they capture different aspects of degradation that might help with the 8-point gap, even if the composite dynamic range decreased slightly. The key insight is that degradation makes signals less stationary, which these features directly measure.
