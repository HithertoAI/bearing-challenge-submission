v169 METHODOLOGY: TOTAL VARIATION DUAL-REGIME SMOOTHING
Technical Approach:
This methodology reconstructs the chronological timeline of a bearing failure by integrating Regime-Specific Physics Models with a Total Variation (TV) Smoothing Algorithm. It rejects the assumption that degradation is purely linear or purely chaotic, instead modeling it as a continuous physical accumulation of damage that is obscured by sensor noise ("jitter"). The timeline is reconstructed by minimizing local metric variance within two distinct physical regimes.
Hypothesis:
The true degradation curve is monotonic. Local violations of monotonicity in the data are artifacts of sensor variance, not physical self-repair. By identifying the dominant physical force in each stage of life (Friction vs. Fracture) and applying a smoothing optimization, the true order can be recovered.
Regime 1: Lubrication Breakdown (Start Phase)
* Physics: The bearing surfaces are geometrically intact but suffering from lubricant film loss. Asperity contact generates high-frequency friction without distinct impact events.
* Metric: Ultrasonic Friction Floor.
* Formula: $10^{th} \text{ Percentile RMS } (35\text{–}45 \text{ kHz})$.
* Rationale: Standard RMS is contaminated by transient debris passing through the load zone. The 10th percentile filter rejects these outliers, isolating the rising "background friction" floor. This serves as the only stable "clock" during the early wear phase before macroscopic damage appears.
Regime 2: Structural Fatigue (End Phase)
* Physics: Macroscopic failure dominates. Pits widen into spalls, and component geometry degrades, altering the load distribution.
* Metric: Structural Intensity.
* Formula: $RMS_{broadband} \times (1 + \text{Kurtosis}_{fisher})$.
* Rationale: This metric resolves the "Smearing Paradox" common in late-stage failure.
   * Early Spalling: High Kurtosis (sharp impacts), Moderate RMS.
   * Terminal Smearing: Low Kurtosis (blunt impacts), High RMS.
   * Solution: By multiplying Energy (RMS) by Impulsiveness (Kurtosis), this metric scores both "spiky" defects and "smeared" catastrophic failure as progressively higher damage states, ensuring a continuous timeline.
Algorithm: Total Variation Smoothing
To resolve local ordering errors (swaps) caused by sensor noise, a Sliding Window Optimization is applied to the sequence generated by the physics metrics.
1. Window Configuration: A sliding window of 4 files traverses the dataset.
2. Local Optimization: Within the window, files are re-sorted based strictly on the active regime's metric (Friction for the first ~65%, Structural Intensity for the remainder).
3. Result: This technique minimizes the "Total Variation" (sum of local jumps) of the curve, repairing local jaggedness while rigorously preserving the global trend established by the physics model.
Boundary Conditions & Constraints:
* Genesis ($t=0$): File 15. Identified as the lowest friction state, anchoring the timeline.
* Terminal ($t=1$): Files 33, 49, 51. These files are locked to the final positions based on their maximal Structural Intensity scores, representing the loss of geometric integrity (terminal smearing).
