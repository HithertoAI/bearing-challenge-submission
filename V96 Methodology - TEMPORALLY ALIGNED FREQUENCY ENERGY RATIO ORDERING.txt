V96 Methodology - TEMPORALLY ALIGNED FREQUENCY ENERGY RATIO ORDERING
APPROACH:
Utilizes high-frequency to low-frequency vibration energy ratio calculated from properly temporally aligned data windows to track bearing degradation progression.
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Extract first 2-second window of zero-crossing tachometer timestamps (0.0-2.0 seconds)
2. Calculate vibration energy ratio: high-frequency (≥5000 Hz) / low-frequency (<1000 Hz)
3. Order files by increasing energy ratio score
PHYSICAL BASIS:
* High-frequency energy increase indicates developing bearing surface defects and impact events
* Low-frequency energy represents baseline mechanical operation
* Energy ratio amplifies degradation signature while normalizing operational variations
* Temporal alignment ensures accurate rotational speed context for frequency analysis
INNOVATION VALUE:
* Pure physical approach focusing on fundamental bearing failure mechanics
* Optimal temporal alignment between vibration data and tachometer reference
* Eliminates misalignment artifacts from previous methods
* Provides clear degradation progression from healthy to failure state
SEQUENCE RESULT:
Files ordered by frequency energy ratio, showing progression from healthy (low ratios: file 35) to degraded (high ratios: file 51). Ratio range: 219.99 - 585.11.
