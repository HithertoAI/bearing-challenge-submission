V93 METHODOLOGY: BEARING DEGRADATION CHRONOLOGICAL ORDERING - SPIKE-BASED
BEARING DEGRADATION CHRONOLOGICAL ORDERING - SPIKE-BASED METHODOLOGY


APPROACH:
This solution uses spike/impact analysis to determine chronological order in bearing degradation. As bearings deteriorate, individual impact events become more severe, leading to higher maximum spike amplitudes in the vibration signal.


PHYSICAL BASIS:
- Healthy bearings: Relatively uniform vibration with moderate spikes
- Degraded bearings: Severe individual impacts from bearing surface defects
- Maximum spike amplitude increases monotonically with damage progression


TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. For each 2-second vibration recording, identify significant spikes (2σ threshold)
2. Extract maximum spike amplitude as primary degradation indicator
3. Sort files by increasing max_spike values
4. Lowest max_spike = earliest/healthiest bearing state
5. Highest max_spike = latest/most degraded bearing state


KEY INSIGHTS:
- Based on visual waveform analysis comparing early vs late files
- Focuses on impact severity rather than overall vibration energy
- Aligns with physical bearing failure mechanisms
- Simple, interpretable, and physically meaningful


VALIDATION:
- Consistent with observed waveform patterns (File 18 > File 3 spike heights)
- Multiple spike metrics analyzed (max_spike, count, frequency)
- Max_spike showed clearest progression for chronological ordering


INNOVATION VALUE:
Provides a robust, physically-grounded method for tracking bearing degradation progression using impact severity rather than complex spectral features.
