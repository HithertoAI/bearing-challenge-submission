V108 METHODOLOGY: PURE DEGRADATION ANALYSIS
Data-driven approach focusing exclusively on physical degradation indicators, eliminating operational variability bias.
Technical Approach:
* Fault Energy Ratio: Ratio of bearing fault frequency energy (cage, ball, inner race, outer race) to total vibration energy
* Impact Regularity: Measures periodicity of vibration impacts using coefficient of variation analysis
* High-Frequency RMS: RMS of high-pass filtered signal (>10kHz) to detect surface damage
* Combined Degradation Index: Weighted combination (70% fault energy, 20% impact regularity, 10% HF content)
Physical Rationale:
* True Degradation Focus: Bearing fault energy ratio increases with accumulating damage regardless of operational conditions
* Impact Pattern Changes: Damaged bearings produce more regular impact patterns than healthy random variations
* Surface Damage Detection: High-frequency content increases with surface roughness and material degradation
* Operational Invariance: Ratios and patterns are less sensitive to flight cycle variations than absolute energy measures
Key Innovation:
* No Preconceived Assumptions: Complete disregard for previous "incident file" hypotheses
* Pure Physical Signals: Exclusive focus on features that change only with material state
* Statistical Outlier Detection: Letting the true failure file emerge naturally from degradation metrics
* Sparse Sampling Optimization: Designed for identifying single failure event among sparse samples
Results:
* Degradation Index range: 0.480314 to 0.558499 units
* Clear failure cluster: Files 33, 24, 14, 08, 51 identified as most degraded
* Healthy baseline: Files 34, 03, 35, 37, 25 identified as least degraded


This approach reveals the true degradation progression by filtering out operational variability and focusing on physical damage accumulation signatures.
