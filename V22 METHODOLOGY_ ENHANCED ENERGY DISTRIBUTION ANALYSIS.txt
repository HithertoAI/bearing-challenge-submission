V22 METHODOLOGY: ENHANCED ENERGY DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS
APPROACH:
Advanced energy distribution analysis using multiple strategic frequency bands while maintaining V18's proven equal-weighting structure.
CORE INNOVATION:
* Multi-Band Energy Analysis: Five frequency bands covering ultra-low to ultra-high frequencies
* Strategic Ratios: Impact Ratio, Resonance Ratio, and Broadband Ratio
* Proven Foundation: Maintains V18's equal weighting and feature structure
FREQUENCY BANDS:
* Ultra-Low (10-100 Hz): Very low frequency components
* Low (100-1000 Hz): Shaft/gear frequency domain
* Mid (1000-5000 Hz): Bearing fault frequencies
* High (5000-15000 Hz): Impact resonance region
* Ultra-High (15000-25000 Hz): High-frequency noise/impacts
ENERGY RATIOS:
* Impact Ratio: High/Low band energy (classic approach)
* Resonance Ratio: Ultra-High/Mid band energy (high-frequency resonance)
* Broadband Ratio: (High+Ultra-High)/(Low+Mid) energy (comprehensive measure)
FEATURE SET:
* RMS (overall energy)
* Kurtosis (impulsiveness)
* Crest Factor (peak-to-RMS)
* Broadband Ratio (selected as most comprehensive energy measure)
RESULTS:
* Health Index Range: 0.7023 to 3.0533
* Dynamic Range: 4.35×
* Broadband Ratio Range: 0.391 to 1.638 (4.19× range)
STRATEGIC POSITION:
Builds on V18's success with more sophisticated energy distribution analysis while avoiding the weighting pitfalls of V21.
