V61 METHODOLOGY: TEMPORAL EVOLUTION SLOPE-BASED RANKING
Technical Approach:
* Within-File Segmentation: Division of each 2-second measurement into 10 temporal segments for evolution tracking
* RMS Slope Extraction: Linear regression across segment RMS values to quantify energy trend direction and magnitude
* Temporal Progression Hypothesis: Files exhibiting positive RMS slopes indicate active, ongoing degradation processes
* Negative Slope Interpretation: Energy decrease during measurement suggesting late-stage failure or stabilization states
* Consensus Validation: Cross-verification with 7 independent temporal ranking strategies achieving 6/7 agreement on extreme cases
* Dynamic vs Static Differentiation: Ranking based on how signals evolve rather than absolute magnitude averages
Physical Rationale:
* Active Degradation Signature: Healthy bearings maintain stable energy; degrading bearings show rising energy as damage progresses during operation
* Measurement-Scale Evolution: 2-second windows capture real-time degradation dynamics invisible to static feature extraction
* Energy Trend Monotonicity: Positive slopes provide consistent degradation indicator across measurement period
* Multi-Phase Failure Recognition: Negative slopes may represent advanced breakdown where bearing fragments cause energy dissipation
* Temporal Context Integration: Evolution patterns reveal degradation stage more reliably than instantaneous feature snapshots
Results:
* RMS slope range: -0.431117 to 0.260765
* Healthiest (rank 1): file_52 with slope -0.431117 (energy dropping)
* Most degraded (rank 53): file_20 with slope 0.260765 (energy rising)
* Consensus validation: file_20, file_50, file_27 confirmed as most degraded by 6/7 independent strategies
* Temporal feature extraction from 53 files × 10 segments = 530 data points analyzed
This temporal evolution approach fundamentally differs from all prior methods by analyzing how vibration characteristics change during each measurement rather than treating files as static snapshots.
