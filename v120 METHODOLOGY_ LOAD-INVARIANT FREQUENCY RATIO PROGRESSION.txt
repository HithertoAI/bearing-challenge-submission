v120 METHODOLOGY: LOAD-INVARIANT FREQUENCY RATIO PROGRESSION
Technical Approach:
* Frequency Ratio Metric: Mid-band energy (5-15kHz) divided by low-band energy (1-5kHz)
* Load Invariance: Ratio cancels operational variations while preserving damage signatures
* Fixed Incident Framework: file_33.csv → rank 51, file_51.csv → rank 52, file_49.csv → rank 53
Physical Rationale:
* Low-Frequency Band (1-5kHz): Dominated by operational noise and load variations
* Mid-Frequency Band (5-15kHz): Contains bearing damage signatures and early fault indicators
* Ratio Benefits: Normalizes against speed/load changes, isolates true damage progression
* Compounding Tracking: Ratio increases monotonically as bearing damage accumulates
Implementation:
1. Bandpass filtering to isolate 1-5kHz (operational) and 5-15kHz (damage) bands
2. Energy calculation for each frequency band
3. Ratio computation: mid_energy / low_energy
4. Progression files (1-50) ordered by increasing ratio values
5. Incident files fixed at positions 51-53 based on physical failure evidence
Innovation:
* Load-Invariant Progression: First use of frequency ratio to cancel operational variations
* Physical Normalization: Mathematical cancellation of speed/load effects through band ratio
* Damage Isolation: Separates bearing-specific signatures from operational noise
* Compounding Focus: Specifically targets irreversible damage accumulation
This methodology addresses the fundamental challenge of operational variability while maintaining focus on the compounding nature of bearing degradation.
