V73 METHODOLOGY: Manifold Learning Reconstruction
Approach Overview
V73 employs manifold learning to reconstruct the bearing degradation timeline by discovering the intrinsic one-dimensional progression path through high-dimensional feature space. The method assumes that bearing degradation follows a continuous trajectory that can be captured through nonlinear dimensionality reduction.
Technical Implementation
1. Multi-Domain Feature Extraction
For each vibration signal, we compute 12 diverse features spanning:
* Time Domain: Mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis
* Amplitude Statistics: 95th percentile, absolute 95th percentile
* Frequency Domain: Low/mid/high frequency energy bands
* Spectral Characteristics: Dominant frequency bin, magnitude, spectral entropy
2. Manifold Learning with t-SNE
* Standardize all features to zero mean and unit variance
* Apply t-SNE with 1-dimensional target space (perplexity=15)
* The algorithm nonlinearly projects 12D feature space to 1D manifold
* Each file's position on this manifold represents its degradation state
3. Degradation Sequence Extraction
* Sort files by their 1D manifold coordinates
* Assign ranks 1-53 based on manifold position
* Lower manifold values indicate healthier states
* Higher manifold values indicate more degraded states
Theoretical Basis


Key AdvantagesBearing degradation evolves continuously through a complex, high-dimensional feature space. While individual features may exhibit non-monotonic behavior, the underlying degradation trajectory forms a smooth 1D manifold. Manifold learning uncovers this intrinsic progression by preserving local neighborhood relationships while revealing global structure.
* Captures nonlinear degradation patterns missed by linear methods
* Combines information from multiple feature domains
* No assumptions about specific fault frequency evolution
* Naturally handles the unidirectional nature of degradation
* Robust to local fluctuations in individual features
Expected Performance
This approach should outperform correlation-based methods by focusing on the global degradation trajectory rather than pairwise similarity. The manifold coordinates provide a physically meaningful representation of degradation state progression.
