V41 METHODOLOGY: AMPLIFIED BEARING HEALTH INDICATORS
Leveraging zero-crossing timing data for precise operational analysis combined with multi-band vibration energy assessment.


Technical Approach:
* Zero-Crossing Timing Analysis: Speed stability measurement from revolution timing intervals
* Multi-Band Spectral Energy: High-frequency (6-8 kHz) and ultra-high-frequency (8-12 kHz) bearing energy quantification
* Time-Domain Features: Crest factor and kurtosis for impact detection and signal characterization
* Amplified Health Index: Weighted combination emphasizing high-frequency energy and speed instability


Physical Rationale:
* Speed Stability: Bearing degradation causes rotational instability detectable in timing variations
* High-Frequency Energy: Advanced bearing faults excite ultrasonic frequency ranges
* Crest Factor & Kurtosis: Sensitive to impulsive impacts from surface defects and spalling


Results:
* Health Index range: 3.76 to 7.09 units
* Speed Stability range: 0.00014 to 0.00166
* High-Frequency Energy range: 0.16 to 0.62 units
* Ultra-High-Frequency Energy range: 0.24 to 0.90 units


This approach provides enhanced discrimination through combined timing and high-frequency vibration analysis.
