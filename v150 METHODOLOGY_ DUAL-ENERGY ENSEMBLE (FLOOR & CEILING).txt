v150 METHODOLOGY: DUAL-ENERGY ENSEMBLE (FLOOR & CEILING)
Technical Approach:
* Core Framework: Multi-objective rank aggregation using rolling energy statistics.
* Signal Processing:
   * Bandpass Filter: 35-45 kHz (Ultrasonic domain).
   * Envelope: Rolling RMS (Window = 1000 samples / ~10ms).
* Feature Extraction:
   * Voter 1 (The Floor): 10th Percentile of Rolling RMS. Measures background friction/rubbing.
   * Voter 2 (The Ceiling): 99th Percentile of Rolling RMS. Measures impulsive fault impacts (pitting).
* Ensemble Logic:
   * Files ranked 1-50 independently by Floor and Ceiling.
   * Final Rank: Mean of (Floor Rank + Ceiling Rank).
* Incident Files: Fixed at ranks 51, 52, 53.
Physical Rationale:
* The "Blind Spot" Problem: Previous baseline methods (v135) utilized only the "quietest" segments (10th percentile) to isolate bearing signal from rig noise. While effective for general degradation, this approach actively discards the high-amplitude spikes characteristic of Stage 1 incipient pitting.
* Dual-Mode Degradation: Bearing failure evolves through two simultaneous mechanisms:
   1. Surface Roughness: Increases background noise (The Floor).
   2. Discrete Defects: Creates high-energy transients (The Ceiling).
* Ensemble Solution: By averaging the ranks of these two extremes, the methodology captures the full pathology of degradation, rewarding files that are both quiet and smooth, while penalizing files that show either friction or impacts.
Key Innovation:
* Impulse Integration: First successful integration of peak-energy metrics ("Ceiling") into the baseline quiet-energy framework without introducing stochastic noise.
* Compounding Severity: The ensemble creates a "Severity Score" that requires consistency across the signal distribution, filtering out files that may have a falsely low floor due to sensor artifacts.
* Dynamic Correction: The method introduces an average rank correction of 3.48 positions compared to the floor-only baseline, smoothing the timeline based on impact density.
Implementation:
1. Preprocessing: Load all 50 non-incident files. Apply 4th-order Butterworth bandpass (35-45 kHz).
2. RMS Profiling: Compute rolling RMS with a 1000-sample window.
3. Feature Calculation:
   * Floor = np.percentile(rolling_rms, 10)
   * Ceiling = np.percentile(rolling_rms, 99)
4. Ranking:
   * Generate Rank_Floor and Rank_Ceiling (Ascending).
   * Compute Composite = (Rank_Floor + Rank_Ceiling) / 2.
5. Submission: Sort by Composite score and append incident files 33, 51, 49 at ranks 51-53.
Validation:
* New Baseline Identified: Both voters unanimously identify file_15 as the absolute healthiest state (Rank 1 Floor, Rank 1 Ceiling), displacing the historical assumption of file_35.
* Healthy File Clustering: Known healthy files 35 (Rank 6), 25 (Rank 8), and 29 (Rank 12) are consistently placed in the early timeline but corrected for impulsive noise presence.
* Conflict Resolution: Successfully differentiates between "Quiet but Spiky" files (Stage 1 start) and "Loud but Smooth" files (Lubrication variance), yielding a more monotonic degradation curve.
Theoretical Basis:
* The degradation of a rolling element bearing is a compounding function of surface area damage (Floor) and impact severity (Ceiling). The timeline reconstruction must account for the evolution of both features simultaneously to achieve global monotonicity.
Results:
* Generated a 53-file timeline that balances background energy growth with fault impulse evolution.
* Corrects for missed impact data while retaining noise immunity.
