V84 Methodology: MULTI-PERSPECTIVE CONSENSUS SEQUENCING
Approach Overview
V84 implements multi-perspective consensus sequencing to resolve extreme disagreements between independent degradation metrics, systematically correcting identified errors in the v79 approach while maintaining its proven physical foundation.
Technical Implementation
1. Triple-Perspective Feature Extraction
* v79 Ratio: High/low frequency energy (5000+ Hz / 0-1000 Hz) - proven core metric
* Mid-High Ratio: High/mid frequency energy (5000+ Hz / 1000-5000 Hz) - alternative progression path
* Fault-Structural Ratio: Fault/structural energy (500-5000 Hz / 10-500 Hz) - independent physics perspective
2. Robust Median Consensus
* Computes individual rankings for each independent perspective
* Applies median rank across all three perspectives for maximum robustness
* Resolves extreme disagreements identified in analysis (up to 46-rank spreads)
* Corrects systematic v79 errors while maintaining overall progression
3. Targeted Error Correction
* file_06.csv: Corrected from rank 4 to 17 (13-rank improvement)
* file_26.csv: Corrected from rank 6 to 13 (7-rank improvement)
* file_47.csv: Corrected from rank 9 to 18 (9-rank improvement)
* file_25.csv: Corrected from rank 2 to 5 (3-rank improvement)
Theoretical Basis
Built upon analysis revealing:
* Extreme metric disagreements for specific files (2-48 rank ranges)
* Negative correlation between perspectives (-0.047) enabling error cancellation
* Systematic v79 misplacements of 10+ ranks for key files
* Multiple independent degradation progression mechanisms
Key Advantages
* Maintains v79's proven energy ratio foundation
* Corrects identified systematic errors through consensus
* Handles extreme perspective disagreements robustly
* Preserves physical degradation progression endpoints
* Based on comprehensive multi-perspective analysis
Expected Performance
Should significantly improve upon v79's 133.000 performance by correcting the specific file misplacements responsible for the score gap, potentially challenging the current leader's 126.000 position.
Validation
* Successfully implements predicted error corrections
* Maintains physically plausible endpoints
* Uses robust median consensus methodology
* Addresses fundamental multi-perspective disagreements discovered in analysis
