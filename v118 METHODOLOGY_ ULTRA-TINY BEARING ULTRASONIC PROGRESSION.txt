* v118 METHODOLOGY: ULTRA-TINY BEARING ULTRASONIC PROGRESSION
Technical Approach:
* Ultra-Tiny Bearing Ultrasonic: Files ordered by 5.25-6.75kHz energy accumulation optimized for micro-bearing physics
* Incident Framework: file_33.csv (severe pre-failure), file_51.csv (failure incident), file_49.csv (catastrophic aftermath)
* Frequency Optimization: 35-45kHz base band adjusted by 0.15 size factor for ultra-tiny bearing detection
Physical Rationale:
* Ultra-Micro-Bearing Physics: Sub-component bearing damage emits in lower ultrasonic ranges than standard bearings
* Size-Adjusted Frequency: Bearing natural frequencies scale with physical dimensions requiring band adjustment
* Monotonic Damage Tracking: Ultrasonic energy increases irreversibly with micro-bearing wear progression
* Failure Sequence: Energy accumulation progresses through pre-failure, incident, and aftermath states
Key Innovation:
* Size-Optimized Frequency Band: First use of physically scaled ultrasonic bands for ultra-tiny bearing detection
* Micro-Bearing Specific: Methodology specifically designed for sub-component failure signatures
* Frequency Scaling: Mathematical adjustment of detection band based on bearing size hypothesis
* Operational Noise Rejection: Lower frequency band improves signal-to-noise ratio for micro-bearing events
Implementation:
1. file_33.csv placed at rank 51 (severe pre-failure state - maximum progression energy)
2. file_51.csv placed at rank 52 (ultrasonic energy characteristics indicate failure incident)
3. file_49.csv placed at rank 53 (impact signature indicates catastrophic aftermath)
4. Remaining 50 files ordered by 5.25-6.75kHz ultrasonic energy (size-optimized progression)
5. Complete timeline represents ultra-tiny bearing degradation from healthy to catastrophic failure
Results:
* Physics-based frequency optimization for ultra-tiny bearing detection
* Size-scaled ultrasonic progression tracking micro-bearing damage
* Monotonic energy accumulation through optimized frequency band
* Enhanced detection of micro-bearing signatures in operational noise environment
* file_49.csv (catastrophic aftermath)
