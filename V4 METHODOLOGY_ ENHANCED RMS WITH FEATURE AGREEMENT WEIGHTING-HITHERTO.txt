V4 METHODOLOGY: ENHANCED RMS WITH FEATURE AGREEMENT WEIGHTING

Building on our #5-ranked RMS approach, v4 intelligently combines multiple degradation signals through feature agreement analysis.


Key Innovation:
- Uses RMS as the foundational ranking (proven effective)
- Calculates agreement scores between RMS and other features
- Adjusts rankings for files where features strongly disagree
- Blends complementary degradation signals intelligently


Technical Approach:
- Primary feature: RMS vibration energy
- Secondary features: Spectral kurtosis, outer race energy, peak-to-peak
- Agreement scoring: Measures consensus between features
- Adaptive weighting: High agreement = trust RMS, Low agreement = blend features


Feature Insights Discovered:
- RMS & Peak-to-Peak: Strong agreement (0.93 correlation)
- RMS & Kurtosis: Negative correlation (-0.32) - complementary signals
- RMS & Outer Race: No correlation - independent measures


Rationale:
Rather than abandoning our successful RMS approach, we enhance it by identifying and intelligently handling cases where other features provide conflicting evidence of degradation progression.


This represents a sophisticated ensemble approach that maintains robustness while incorporating multiple physical degradation mechanisms.
