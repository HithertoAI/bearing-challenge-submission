V16 METHODOLOGY: ENVELOPE DEMODULATION HEALTH INDEX
APPROACH:
Physics-informed feature extraction focusing on irreversible bearing degradation processes. Implements a Health Index combining three key vibration features derived from envelope demodulation analysis.
CORE FEATURES:
1. Envelope_RMS: RMS of demodulated signal after band-pass filtering (5-20 kHz resonance region). Tracks impact energy from spalling progression.
2. BPFO_Amplitude: Amplitude of Ball Pass Frequency Outer Race (4408 Hz) in envelope spectrum. Monitors fault-specific frequency component growth.
3. HFRMS: High-frequency RMS of raw vibration signal. Captures overall impact energy increase.
HEALTH INDEX:
Weighted combination: HI = 0.4 × Envelope_RMS + 0.4 × BPFO_Amplitude + 0.2 × HFRMS
PHYSICAL BASIS:
* Spalling Progression: Material loss creates increasing impact energy (monotonic increase in envelope features)
* Fault Development: Growing BPFO amplitude indicates outer race defect severity
* System Response: High-frequency energy redistribution reflects bearing structural degradation
SIGNAL PROCESSING:
* Band-pass filter: 5-20 kHz (bearing resonance region)
* Hilbert transform for envelope extraction
* FFT of envelope for fault frequency analysis
* Files ranked by ascending Health Index (increasing damage)
ADVANTAGE:
Moves beyond simple statistical features to track specific physical degradation mechanisms identified in bearing failure physics.
