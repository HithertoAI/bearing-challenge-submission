V94 Methodology: CORRELATION-BASED MANIFOLD CHRONOLOGICAL ORDERING
APPROACH:
Uses correlation distance in multi-dimensional feature space to discover the intrinsic degradation progression. Files are ordered by their manifold distance from the central point, revealing the natural degradation trajectory.


TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Extract 4 robust features per file (low/high frequency energy, max spike amplitude, RMS vibration)
2. Compute correlation matrix between all file feature vectors
3. Identify center file (most correlated with others in the manifold)
4. Order files by increasing correlation distance from center
5. Assumes bearing degradation follows smooth progression through feature space


PHYSICAL BASIS:
As bearings degrade, their vibration characteristics evolve continuously through feature space. Files with similar feature vectors are closer in time, forming a progression trajectory.


INNOVATION VALUE:
- Discovers intrinsic progression geometry without feature weighting assumptions
- Robust to outliers and feature scaling
- Based on established manifold learning and seriation principles
- Avoids overfitting to specific degradation indicators


SEQUENCE RESULT:
Files ordered by manifold distance from center point, with sequence: [1, 24, 50, ...] → [...] → [7, 33, 18]
