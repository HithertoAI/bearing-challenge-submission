V11 METHODOLOGY: FAULT ENERGY PROGRESSION






PHYSICAL PARAMETERS:
- Sample Rate: 93,750 Hz
- Fault Frequencies: BPFO=4408Hz, BPFI=5781Hz, BSF=3781Hz, FTF=231Hz
- Shaft Speed: 536.27 RPM


APPROACH:
- Calculates Power Spectral Density (PSD) using Welch's method
- Extracts energy in ±50Hz bands around each known fault frequency
- Ranks files by increasing total fault energy
- Maintains RMS vibration as secondary validation


RATIONALE:
- Bearing degradation manifests as increasing energy at characteristic fault frequencies
- Fault energy progression should be monotonic over bearing lifespan
- Uses actual physical system parameters rather than estimated values


This represents our first physics-grounded approach using the specified parameters.
