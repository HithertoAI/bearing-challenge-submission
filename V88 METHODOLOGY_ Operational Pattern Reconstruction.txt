V88 METHODOLOGY: Operational Pattern Reconstruction
Approach Overview
V88 represents a radical departure from degradation-based analysis by reconstructing chronology through operational test patterns rather than bearing degradation progression. This approach completely abandons energy ratio physics in favor of operational regime signatures that may better reflect the true test timeline.
Technical Implementation
1. Operational Feature Extraction
* Speed Consistency: Zero-crossing interval analysis to measure RPM stability
* Load Cycle Patterns: Envelope modulation detection for duty cycle signatures
* Operational Stability: Segment variance analysis for steady-state vs transient operation
* Transient Regime: Kurtosis and impulse detection for operational transitions
* Test Phase Signatures: Spectral band distribution for test phase identification
2. Feature Computation
* Applied Hilbert transform for envelope analysis
* Computed zero-crossing intervals for speed consistency
* Analyzed spectral energy distribution across operational bands
* Calculated statistical stability metrics across signal segments
* Detected transient events through percentile thresholding
3. Multi-Metric Fusion
* Speed Consistency: 40% weight (operational RPM stability)
* Load Cycle Patterns: 30% weight (duty cycle evolution)
* Operational Stability: 20% weight (steady-state operation)
* Transient Regime: 10% weight (operational transitions)
4. Progression-Based Ranking
* Sorted all 53 files by operational progression score
* Assigned ranks 1-53 based on operational evolution
* Start of Test: file_40 (simplest operational pattern)
* End of Test: file_36 (most complex operational pattern)
Theoretical Basis
The operational pattern approach hypothesizes that the true chronological order follows test operational evolution rather than bearing degradation progression. In controlled bearing tests, operational conditions may provide more reliable temporal markers than degradation states.
Feature Characteristics
* Speed Consistency: 1000.000 (identical across all files, indicating constant RPM)
* Load Cycle Patterns: 2196.232 to 15503.296 (7.1× variation, indicating different operational regimes)
* Operational Progression: Natural evolution from simple to complex operational patterns
Key Advantages
* Completely independent of degradation-based assumptions
* Captures test operational evolution rather than component degradation
* Novel approach that may reveal true chronological markers
* Physically interpretable through operational regime analysis
Expected Performance
This radical approach may achieve breakthrough performance if the true chronology follows test operational patterns rather than bearing degradation progression. The constant speed consistency across all files supports the hypothesis of controlled test conditions where operational patterns provide reliable temporal markers.
