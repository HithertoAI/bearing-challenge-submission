V72 METHODOLOGY: BI-DIRECTIONAL SIMILARITY CHAIN RECONSTRUCTION
Technical Approach:
* V18 Feature Extraction: Four-component feature vector calculated per file (RMS, kurtosis, crest factor, high/low frequency energy ratio)
* Feature Space Normalization: Z-score standardization applied across all features to ensure equal weighting in distance calculations
* Pairwise Similarity Matrix: Euclidean distance computed between all file pairs in normalized 4-dimensional feature space
* Healthiest-First Initialization: Chain construction begins from file exhibiting lowest composite health index (minimum degradation state)
* Greedy Nearest-Neighbor Chaining: Sequential ordering built by iteratively selecting unvisited file with minimum distance to current chain endpoint
* Directional Verification: Final chain direction validated by comparing start/end health indices; reversed if necessary to ensure healthy→degraded progression
Physical Rationale:
* Temporal Adjacency Hypothesis: Chronologically consecutive measurements exhibit greater feature similarity than temporally distant recordings due to gradual degradation progression
* Smooth Degradation Trajectory: Bearing condition evolves continuously rather than discontinuously; adjacent timepoints share similar vibration signatures
* Feature Space Proximity as Temporal Marker: Files close in 4D feature space (RMS, kurtosis, crest factor, energy ratio) likely proximate in test timeline
* Healthiest-First Anchor: Starting from minimum degradation state provides reliable temporal origin, assuming test began with undamaged bearing
* Greedy Optimization Limitation: Nearest-neighbor approach trades global optimality for computational tractability; builds locally coherent progression
* Degradation Vector Alignment: Health index gradient (79.04→112.85) confirms chain direction matches expected healthy-to-failed progression
