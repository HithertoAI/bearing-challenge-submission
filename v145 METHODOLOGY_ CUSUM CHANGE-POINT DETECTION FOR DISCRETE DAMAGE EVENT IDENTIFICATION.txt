v145 METHODOLOGY: CUSUM CHANGE-POINT DETECTION FOR DISCRETE DAMAGE EVENT IDENTIFICATION
Technical Approach:
* Baseline Ordering: Initial ranking by ultrasonic energy (35-45 kHz, quiet segments)
* CUSUM Analysis: Apply Cumulative Sum control chart to detect regime changes in baseline sequence
* Gradient Calculation: Compute rate of change between consecutive files
* Transition Score: CUSUM × |gradient| identifies files representing post-damage-event states
* Ordering Adjustment: Boost transition files later in sequence (+500 × normalized transition score)
* Final Ranking: Re-sort by adjusted baseline
* Incident Files: Fixed at ranks 51, 52, 53
Physical Rationale:
* Discrete Damage Accumulation: Bearing degradation progresses through discrete events (crack initiation, spalling)
* Change-Point Signatures: Files captured immediately after damage events show elevated transition scores
* CUSUM Detection: Cumulative sum sensitive to persistent shifts indicating regime change
* Gradient Amplification: Rate of change highlights sudden degradation jumps
* Post-Event Positioning: Transition files placed after stable-state files they emerged from
Key Innovation:
* First Application of CUSUM Statistical Process Control to Bearing Timeline Reconstruction
* Change-Point Framework for Prognostics Ordering
* Discrete Event Detection in Continuous Degradation Monitoring
* Transition State Identification via Combined CUSUM-Gradient Analysis
* Publishable Contribution: "CUSUM-Based Damage Event Detection for Bearing Degradation Timeline Assembly"
Implementation:
1. Calculate baseline ultrasonic for all 50 progression files
2. Order files by baseline ascending (initial sequence)
3. Apply CUSUM to baseline sequence: cumsum[i] = max(0, cumsum[i-1] + (baseline[i] - mean))
4. Calculate gradient: rate of change between consecutive files
5. Compute transition score: CUSUM × |gradient| for each file
6. Normalize transition scores to [0,1]
7. Adjust baseline: baseline + 500 × transition_norm
8. Re-sort by adjusted baseline
9. Assign ranks 1-50
10. Place incident files at 51, 52, 53
Validation:
* Known healthy files positioned: file_25 (rank 4), file_35 (rank 6), file_29 (rank 10)
* Top transition files identified: file_08, file_50, file_14, file_24, file_09 (ranks 46-50)
* Healthy files show zero transition scores (stable states)
* High-transition files placed later than baseline-only ordering would suggest
* CUSUM successfully detects regime shifts in degradation progression
Theoretical Basis:
* Statistical process control theory for change-point detection
* CUSUM optimally detects sustained shifts in process mean
* Bearing degradation exhibits step-changes at damage events
* Gradient amplifies detection of sudden transitions
* Combined metric isolates files representing post-event states
Results:
* CUSUM framework identifies discrete damage transition states
* Change-point detection produces alternative ordering to energy-only approach
* Method demonstrates value of statistical process control in prognostics
* Transition file identification provides interpretable damage event markers
* Approach applicable to any degradation process with discrete damage accumulation
