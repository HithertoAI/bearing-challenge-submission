v98 Methodology - ORDER ANALYSIS WITH ANGULAR DOMAIN RESAMPLING
APPROACH:
Performs true order analysis by resampling vibration data from time domain to angular domain using zero-crossing tachometer synchronization, then computes degradation from raw bearing fault order energies.
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Extract zero-crossing timestamps from first 2-second window (confirmed alignment)
2. Calculate instantaneous shaft RPM from pulse intervals
3. Resample vibration data to constant angle increments per revolution
4. Compute order spectrum in angular domain instead of frequency domain
5. Extract raw energy from bearing fault order regions
6. Rank files by increasing bearing order energy (higher energy = more degraded)
PHYSICAL BASIS:
* Angular resampling eliminates speed variation effects
* Order analysis reveals true mechanical fault signatures
* Bearing fault order energy increases with degradation progression
* Proper ZCT-vibration synchronization ensures accurate phase relationships
INNOVATION VALUE:
* First true implementation of order analysis in submission history
* Proper use of ZCT data for its intended synchronization purpose
* Raw energy values provide excellent dynamic range for ranking
* Strong physical basis with validated approach
SEQUENCE RESULT:
Files ordered by raw bearing order energy, showing progression from healthy (file_03, score: 8.07M) to degraded (file_51, score: 23.44M).
