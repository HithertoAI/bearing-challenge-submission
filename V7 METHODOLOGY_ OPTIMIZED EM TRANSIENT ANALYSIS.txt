V7 METHODOLOGY: OPTIMIZED EM TRANSIENT ANALYSIS


Key Optimizations:


    Lower filter cutoff (500Hz): Captures broader transient frequency range


    More sensitive peak detection (1.5σ): Identifies weaker transient events


    Higher transient weighting (0.2): Increases influence of transient energy on final score


    Reduced peak distance (50 samples): Detects closely-spaced transient bursts


Technical Improvements:


    Detected 132,229 transient peaks (116% increase over V6)


    Expanded sensitivity to early-stage fault signatures


    Better capture of intermittent bearing faults


    Maintains RMS foundation while emphasizing transient evidence


Rationale:
V6 demonstrated transient analysis potential. V7 pushes sensitivity further to capture subtle fault signatures that may be critical for optimal degradation ordering.
