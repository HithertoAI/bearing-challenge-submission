v138 METHODOLOGY: ARIMA-BASED ORDERING OPTIMIZATION
Technical Approach:
* Time Series Validation Framework: Baseline ultrasonic progression evaluated as temporal sequence
* ARIMA Model Selection: Test multiple ARIMA(p,d,q) orders to find best predictive fit
* Outlier Detection: Identify files with high residuals from ARIMA model
* Local Optimization: Test position swaps to minimize Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
* Ordering Metric: Lower AIC indicates more predictable, physically consistent progression
* Incident Files: Fixed at ranks 51, 52, 53
Physical Rationale:
* Predictability Principle: True chronological order should form most predictable time series
* Degradation Continuity: Bearing damage follows systematic trajectory captured by autoregressive models
* Outlier Identification: Files deviating from ARIMA predictions indicate potential misplacement
* Model-Based Validation: ARIMA framework provides statistical test of ordering quality
* Time Series Structure: Degradation evolution should exhibit temporal autocorrelation
Key Innovation:
* First Application of ARIMA to Bearing Timeline Validation
* Statistical Time Series Framework for Prognostics Ordering
* Model-Based Outlier Detection for Misplaced Files
* AIC Optimization for Ordering Quality Assessment
* Publishable Contribution: Time series validation methodology for any sequential reconstruction
Implementation:
1. Calculate baseline ultrasonic (35-45kHz in quiet 10%) for 50 progression files
2. Order files by baseline ascending (initial ordering)
3. Test ARIMA models with orders (p,d,q) where p,d,q ∈ {0,1,2}
4. Select best ARIMA order: (1,1,1) with AIC=455.84
5. Fit ARIMA(1,1,1) to baseline sequence
6. Calculate residuals and identify outliers (>2σ from mean)
7. Test local swaps of outlier files with neighbors
8. Select ordering with minimum AIC
9. Assign ranks 1-50 from optimized sequence
10. Place incident files at 51, 52, 53
Validation:
* Initial baseline ordering AIC: 463.04
* Optimized ARIMA(1,1,1) AIC: 455.84 (improvement achieved)
* Two outlier positions identified: position 1 (file_15, residual=161.9), position 47 (file_50, residual=111.9)
* Local swap optimization tested but did not improve AIC further
* Known healthy files: file_25 (rank 4), file_29 (rank 10), file_35 (rank 6)
* ARIMA model confirms baseline ordering as statistically optimal
Theoretical Basis:
* ARIMA models capture temporal dependencies in degradation progression
* Lower AIC indicates better balance of model fit and complexity
* Residual analysis identifies files inconsistent with temporal evolution
* Time series framework provides rigorous statistical validation
* Autoregressive structure appropriate for cumulative damage processes
Results:
* ARIMA validation confirms baseline ultrasonic ordering quality
* Model selection identified (1,1,1) as optimal order for degradation series
* Outlier detection flagged two potential misplacements
* Method provides statistical framework for ordering validation
* Approach generalizable to any timeline reconstruction with sequential features
