V27 METHODOLOGY: SIGNAL ENTROPY DEGRADATION INDEX
APPROACH:
Radical departure from bearing-specific features to information-theoretic signal complexity measurement. Uses Shannon entropy to capture degradation-induced signal disorder.
CORE INNOVATION:
* Information-theoretic analysis instead of physical fault detection
* Signal entropy computation from vibration amplitude distribution
* Complexity-based ordering based on signal disorder progression
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Compute histogram of vibration signal amplitudes (50 bins)
2. Calculate Shannon entropy: H = -Σ p(x) log p(x)
3. Sort files by entropy values ascending
4. Lower entropy = healthier (more ordered signal)
5. Higher entropy = more degraded (more disordered signal)
PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:
* Healthy bearings: Regular, predictable vibration patterns (low entropy)
* Degrading bearings: Irregular, chaotic vibration patterns (high entropy)
* Entropy increases as signal becomes less structured with fault progression
VALIDATION:
* Entropy Range: 0.6086 to 1.1777
* Dynamic Range: 1.94×
* Monotonicity Score: 0.400 (best among tested features)
* Healthiest file: file_51.csv (0.6086 entropy)
* Most degraded file: file_37.csv (1.1777 entropy)
STRATEGIC POSITION:
First submission using information-theoretic complexity measures instead of traditional vibration analysis, targeting fundamental signal disorder rather than specific fault frequencies.
