V102 Methodology: Specific Sample Point Chronological Ordering


Approach: This method uses the vibration data value at a fixed temporal position (index 1000, approximately 0.0107 seconds into the 2-second recording) as the sole ordering feature. Files are ranked by this specific data point value.


Rationale: In long-duration controlled tests, measurement system characteristics, environmental conditions, or signal baseline properties may evolve systematically over time. By examining a consistent temporal position across all samples, this approach captures potential systematic drifts or changes that correlate with test timeline progression.


Technical Details:
- Feature: Vibration amplitude at sample index 1000
- Sampling: 93,750 Hz, so index 1000 = 0.01067 seconds
- Ranking: Ascending values (lower amplitudes receive better ranks)
- Data: Uses only vibration data, no ZCT processing


Innovation: This minimal-feature approach tests whether simple, fixed-position sampling can reveal chronological patterns in long-duration test data, representing an extremely parsimonious method for temporal ordering.
