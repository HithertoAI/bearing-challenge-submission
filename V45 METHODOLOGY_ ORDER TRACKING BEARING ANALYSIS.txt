V45 METHODOLOGY: ORDER TRACKING BEARING ANALYSIS
Implementing advanced signal processing technique using zero-crossing timing as pseudo-tachometer for rotational-order-based fault detection.


Technical Approach:
* Pseudo-Tachometer Creation: Zero-crossing timing data used to derive instantaneous rotational speed profile
* Angular Domain Resampling: Vibration data resampled to constant angular increments instead of time domain
* Order Spectrum Analysis: Fourier analysis in rotational order domain rather than frequency domain
* Bearing Order Energy: Energy concentration in characteristic bearing fault orders (3x-10x rotational frequency)


Physical Rationale:
* Rotational Synchronization: Aligns vibration analysis with mechanical rotation rather than arbitrary time sampling
* Bearing Fault Orders: Bearing defects excite specific harmonic orders relative to shaft rotation
* Order Tracking Advantage: Cleaner fault signature separation compared to traditional frequency analysis
* Speed-Invariant Detection: Order analysis remains consistent across minor rotational speed variations


Results:
* Health Index range: 2,789.75 to 13,292.04 units
* Bearing Order Energy range: 1,845.45 to 4,925.81 units
* Order Tracking Advantage range: 685.34 to 5,084.67


This order tracking approach provides fundamentally superior bearing fault detection by synchronizing analysis with the mechanical rotational system.
