V83 METHODOLOGY: Revised PHASE-AWARE SEQUENCING 
Approach Overview
V83 implements corrected phase-aware sequencing using absolute energy ratios instead of normalized percentages, fixing the fundamental physics error discovered in v82 while preserving the cascade failure phase insights.
Technical Implementation
1. Absolute Energy Ratio Computation
* Computes absolute energy in each frequency band (not normalized by total energy)
* Uses structural energy (10-500 Hz) as denominator for all ratios
* Maintains the proven v79 ratio foundation (impact/structural energy)
2. Phase-Aware Ratio Combination
* v79 ratio (impact/structural): 50% weight - proven foundation
* Ball fault ratio: 20% weight - early phase indicator
* Outer race ratio: 15% weight - mid phase indicator
* Cage fault ratio: 15% weight - late phase indicator
3. Physics-Corrected Sequencing
* Sorts by combined ratio score (lower = healthier, higher = more degraded)
* Maintains correct degradation direction established in v79
* Incorporates component-specific failure timing insights
Theoretical Basis
Corrects the normalization error where:
* Absolute fault energies increase with degradation
* But normalized percentages decreased due to overwhelming total energy growth
* Ratios against structural energy provide stable degradation indicators
Validation
* Maintains v79's proven energy ratio foundation
* Corrects the catastrophic direction reversal from v82
* Preserves phase transition insights with proper implementation
