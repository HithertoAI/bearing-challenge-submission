v129 METHODOLOGY: BASELINE ULTRASONIC WITH STRICT QUIET THRESHOLD
Technical Approach:
* Fixed Incident Framework: file_33.csv → rank 51, file_51.csv → rank 52, file_49.csv → rank 53
* Strict Quiet Threshold: 5th percentile of rolling RMS (only the quietest 5% of signal analyzed)
* Baseline Ultrasonic Metric: 35-45kHz energy measured exclusively during extremely calm operational moments
* Monotonic Progression: 50 files ordered by baseline ultrasonic ascending (low→high = healthy→degraded)
Physical Rationale:
* Strictest Noise Floor: Using only the 5% quietest segments isolates the most persistent structural damage signatures
* Operational Immunity: Extreme quiet periods minimize transient operational effects, maximizing degradation signal purity
* Persistent Damage: Even in the calmest moments, bearing damage creates measurable ultrasonic background that healthy bearings lack
Key Difference from v127:
* v127 used 10th percentile quiet threshold
* v129 uses 5th percentile (half as much data, twice as strict)
* Hypothesis: Stricter threshold may better isolate true structural signatures from residual operational noise
Implementation:
1. Calculate rolling RMS (1000-sample windows)
2. Identify 5th percentile threshold (strictest quiet segments)
3. Fallback to 10th percentile if insufficient samples
4. Apply 35-45kHz bandpass filter to quiet segments
5. Calculate baseline ultrasonic energy
6. Sort files ascending by baseline
7. Assign ranks 1-50, incident files at 51-53
Results:
* Stricter quiet threshold captures only the most operationally-stable moments
* Expected to enhance separation between healthy and degraded files
