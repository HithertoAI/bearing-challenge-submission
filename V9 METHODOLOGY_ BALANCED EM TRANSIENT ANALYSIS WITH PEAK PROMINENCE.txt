V9 METHODOLOGY: BALANCED EM TRANSIENT ANALYSIS WITH PEAK PROMINENCE


Refining our successful V6 EM transient approach with intelligent parameter balancing and quality-focused transient measurement.


Key Innovations:
- Balanced filter frequency (750Hz) between conservative V6 and sensitive V7
- Optimized peak detection threshold (1.75σ) for better signal-to-noise ratio
- Peak prominence weighting emphasizes transient quality over quantity
- Smart distance parameter (75 samples) for closely-spaced transient groups


Technical Refinements:
- Filter: 750Hz high-pass Butterworth (4th order)
- Peak detection: Height = 1.75 × standard deviation, Distance = 75 samples
- Transient metric: Weighted sum of (peak prominence × peak height)
- Combined score: RMS + (Weighted transients × 0.15)


Quality Focus:
- Detected 86,083 transient peaks (optimal middle ground)
- Average prominence: 81.77 (high-quality transient events)
- Emphasizes physically meaningful transients over noise
- Maintains RMS foundation while improving transient sensitivity


Rationale:
V6 was conservative, V7 was oversensitive. V9 finds the optimal balance, capturing genuine fault transients while rejecting noise, using peak prominence to weight transient importance.
