V68 METHODOLOGY: DEGRADATION ORDERING WITH ZCT RATE VARIANCE CORRECTION
Technical Approach:
* Composite Health Index: Weighted combination of time-domain and frequency-domain features (RMS vibration + kurtosis×10 + crest_factor×5 + energy_ratio×2)
* Energy Ratio Metric: High-frequency band energy (5000-20000 Hz) divided by low-frequency band energy (10-1000 Hz) as degradation indicator
* ZCT Rate Variance Analysis: Zero-crossing tachometer differential (np.diff of valid samples) quantifies rotational speed stability
* Speed Stability Detection: Variance of ZCT rate sequence identifies transient versus steady-state operating conditions
* Operating Condition Correction: Normalized ZCT rate variance scaled by 15% of mean health index, subtracted from base health index
* Corrected Health Ranking: Files ordered by adjusted health index accounting for operating phase artifacts
Physical Rationale:
* ZCT Signal Interpretation: Zero-crossing tachometer represents cumulative shaft rotations (~5 rotations over 2-second measurement window at ~150 RPM nominal speed)
* Rate Variance as Operating Phase Indicator: High variance in rotation rate indicates acceleration/deceleration transients characteristic of startup or load change periods; low variance indicates steady-state operation
* Transient Vibration Artifacts: Variable shaft speed during non-steady conditions creates elevated vibration metrics independent of bearing degradation state
* Degradation Signal Isolation: Files with high speed variation receive health index reduction to prevent misclassifying transient operating signatures as bearing damage
* Energy Ratio Stability: High-to-low frequency energy ratio captures bearing fault progression while maintaining relative insensitivity to operating speed variations
* Chronological Ordering: Corrected health index reflects true degradation progression by compensating for measurement timing within flight cycle phases
Results:
* Base health index range: 79.04 to 112.85
* ZCT rate variance range: 1.82e-12 to 2.48e-10
* Mean rotation rate range: 0.009471 to 0.009524
* Corrected health index range: 69.11 to 109.34
