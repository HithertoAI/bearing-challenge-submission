v179 METHODOLOGY: SIMILARITY-BASED SERIATION ORDERING
Technical Approach:
* Fixed Incident Framework: file_33.csv → rank 51, file_51.csv → rank 52, file_49.csv → rank 53
* Anchor Start: file_15.csv → rank 1 (greedy TSP starting point)
* Seriation Method: 49 middle files ordered by minimizing consecutive-file dissimilarity
* Multi-Feature Distance: 13 normalized features define pairwise file distances
Physical Rationale:
* Narrow Time Window: Files from ~1-2 hour final window, not 150 hours
* Temporal Continuity: Adjacent files in true order should be similar (gradual system evolution)
* Path Smoothness: Chronological order = path through feature space with minimal jumps
* Regime Consistency: Similar operational states cluster together temporally
Key Innovation:
* Paradigm Shift: From "rank by damage level" to "find smoothest temporal path"
* Traveling Salesman Formulation: File ordering as optimization problem
* Multi-Domain Features: Time domain (RMS, kurtosis, crest) + frequency bands (0-46kHz)
* 2-opt Refinement: Local search improves greedy solution quality
Implementation:
1. Extract 13 features per file: RMS, std, kurtosis, skewness, crest, 7 frequency bands, centroid
2. Normalize features to [0,1] range
3. Calculate Euclidean distance matrix (50x50)
4. Greedy TSP from file_15: always visit nearest unvisited neighbor
5. 2-opt improvement: iteratively swap path segments to reduce total distance
6. Append incident files at ranks 51-53
Validation:
* Partial agreement with baseline on late-stage files (8, 14, 50)
* Spearman ρ = 0.24 with baseline (not orthogonal, not identical)
* Path distance optimization converged (27.78 total normalized distance)
* Physically grounded in temporal continuity assumption
Results:
* Novel seriation approach for bearing timeline reconstruction
* Treats ordering as path optimization rather than feature ranking
* Applicable to any time-series reconstruction with temporal continuity
* Independent convergence potential (standard technique, deterministic result)
