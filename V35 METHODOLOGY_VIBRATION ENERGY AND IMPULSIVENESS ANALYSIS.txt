V35 METHODOLOGY: VIBRATION ENERGY AND IMPULSIVENESS ANALYSIS


1. FEATURE SELECTION:
   - RMS Vibration Energy: Overall vibration intensity measure
   - Kurtosis: Statistical measure of signal impulsiveness and tailedness
   - Combined degradation metric: RMS × Kurtosis


2. PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:
   - RMS Energy: Captures overall vibration magnitude and operational intensity
   - Kurtosis: Sensitive to impact events and transient vibrations characteristic of component degradation
   - Combined Metric: Represents both vibration intensity and the presence of impulsive damage signatures


3. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
   - RMS calculation: sqrt(mean(v^2))
   - Kurtosis calculation: mean((v - mean(v))^4) / std(v)^4
   - Degradation score: RMS × Kurtosis
   - Ranking: Increasing degradation scores from healthiest to most degraded


4. VALIDATION BASIS:
   - RMS energy provides robust baseline vibration characterization
   - Kurtosis enhances sensitivity to bearing surface defects and impact events
   - Multiplicative combination amplifies degradation signatures while maintaining physical interpretability
   - Computationally efficient and suitable for real-time monitoring applications
