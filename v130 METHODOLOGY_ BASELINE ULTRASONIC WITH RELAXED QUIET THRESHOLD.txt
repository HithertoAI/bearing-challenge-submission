v130 METHODOLOGY: BASELINE ULTRASONIC WITH RELAXED QUIET THRESHOLD
Technical Approach:
* Fixed Incident Framework: file_33.csv → rank 51, file_51.csv → rank 52, file_49.csv → rank 53
* Relaxed Quiet Threshold: 15th percentile of rolling RMS (broader quiet segment inclusion)
* Baseline Ultrasonic Metric: 35-45kHz energy measured during moderately calm operational moments
* Monotonic Progression: 50 files ordered by baseline ultrasonic ascending (low→high = healthy→degraded)
Physical Rationale:
* Broader Sampling: 15% threshold captures more quiet-period data, providing more robust statistical averaging
* Balance Point: Sufficient operational noise exclusion while maintaining adequate sample size for reliable measurement
* Persistent Damage: Degradation signatures remain visible even in moderately quiet periods, not just extreme calm
Key Difference from v127:
* v127 used 10th percentile quiet threshold
* v130 uses 15th percentile (50% more data included)
* Hypothesis: Broader threshold may provide more statistically stable baseline measurement while still excluding major operational events
Implementation:
1. Calculate rolling RMS (1000-sample windows)
2. Identify 15th percentile threshold (relaxed quiet segments)
3. Fallback to 20th percentile if insufficient samples
4. Apply 35-45kHz bandpass filter to quiet segments
5. Calculate baseline ultrasonic energy
6. Sort files ascending by baseline
7. Assign ranks 1-50, incident files at 51-53
Results:
* Relaxed threshold provides larger sample of quiet-period data
* Expected to offer more stable baseline estimation with reduced sensitivity to outliers
