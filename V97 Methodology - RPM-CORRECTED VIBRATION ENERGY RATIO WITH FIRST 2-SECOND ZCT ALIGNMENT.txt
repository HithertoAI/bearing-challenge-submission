V97 Methodology - RPM-CORRECTED VIBRATION ENERGY RATIO WITH FIRST 2-SECOND ZCT ALIGNMENT
APPROACH:
Utilizes actual shaft speed derived from the first 2-second ZCT window to calculate physically accurate bearing fault frequencies, then computes vibration energy ratio around these RPM-corrected frequency bands.
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Extract zero-crossing timestamps from first 2-second window (0.0-2.0 seconds)
2. Calculate actual shaft RPM and turbine RPM from pulse intervals
3. Scale nominal bearing fault-band centers based on measured vs nominal RPM ratio
4. Compute vibration energy ratio: ball fault band energy / cage fault band energy
5. Order files by increasing energy ratio score
PHYSICAL BASIS:
* RPM-corrected fault frequencies account for actual operating conditions
* Ball fault band energy captures developing bearing impact events
* Cage fault band energy represents baseline mechanical operation
* Energy ratio amplifies degradation signature while normalizing speed variations
* First 2-second ZCT window ensures proper temporal alignment
INNOVATION VALUE:
* Maintains v79 energy ratio concept while incorporating actual physics
* Uses ZCT data for precise RPM-dependent frequency correction
* Ensures temporal alignment between vibration analysis and tachometer reference
* Provides physically accurate degradation progression tracking
SEQUENCE RESULT:
Files ordered by RPM-corrected energy ratio, showing progression from healthy (file 25, ratio: 1015.33) to degraded (file 51, ratio: 2444.39). Ratio range demonstrates clear degradation dynamic.
