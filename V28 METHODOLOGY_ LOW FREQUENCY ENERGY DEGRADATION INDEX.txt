V28 METHODOLOGY: LOW FREQUENCY ENERGY DEGRADATION INDEX
APPROACH:
Focus on fundamental vibration energy in low-frequency operational range, targeting core mechanical energy changes rather than high-frequency fault signatures.
CORE INNOVATION:
* Low-frequency dominance: 0-1000 Hz operational energy monitoring
* Fundamental energy tracking: Overall mechanical energy progression
* Simplified spectral analysis: Single broad low-frequency band
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Compute FFT of vibration signal
2. Extract mean amplitude in 0-1000 Hz frequency band
3. Sort files by low-frequency energy values ascending
4. Lower energy = healthier (smoother operation)
5. Higher energy = more degraded (increased vibration energy)
PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:
* Healthy bearings: Lower fundamental vibration energy
* Degrading bearings: Increased low-frequency vibration as mechanical integrity declines
* Captures overall energy increase from developing mechanical issues
VALIDATION:
* Low Freq Energy Range: 738.8 to 1063.6
* Dynamic Range: 1.44×
* Monotonicity Score: 0.349 (second-best among tested features)
* Healthiest file: file_40.csv (738.8 energy)
* Most degraded file: file_41.csv (1063.6 energy)
STRATEGIC POSITION:
Return to fundamental vibration energy analysis with simplified low-frequency focus, avoiding over-complex feature engineering that has shown limited success.
