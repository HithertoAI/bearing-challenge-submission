V38 METHODOLOGY: CLEAN SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
Addressing numerical stability concerns from previous approaches, V38 implements robust feature extraction with focus on bearing frequency energy while ensuring computational reliability.
Key Innovation:
* Uses numerically stable calculations throughout to prevent overflow and warnings
* Implements robust error handling for all signal processing operations
* Maintains focus on physically meaningful bearing degradation indicators
* Ensures reproducible results suitable for validation review
Technical Approach:
* Stable Kurtosis: Uses scipy.stats.kurtosis with proper error handling
* Robust FFT Analysis: Explicit float64 precision with bounds checking
* Clean Bandpass Filtering: Safe frequency range validation
* Balanced Health Index: Bearing energy (primary) + RMS + Kurtosis + Ultrasonic
Physical Rationale:
* Bearing Frequency Energy: 1-5 kHz band captures characteristic fault frequencies
* RMS: Overall vibration severity indicator
* Kurtosis: Measures impulsiveness from surface defects
* Ultrasonic Energy: Early-stage subsurface fatigue detection
Results:
* Health Index range: 20,729.77 to 42,484.28 units
* Bearing Energy range: 9,873.69 to 20,766.38 units
* RMS range: 24.30 to 50.41 units

This V38 approach provides a stable, reproducible foundation for bearing degradation sequencing while maintaining sensitivity to key physical failure mechanisms.
