V78 METHODOLOGY: DEGRADATION DIRECTION ANALYSIS
Approach Overview
V78 tests the fundamental assumption of degradation direction by reversing the established V18 methodology's ranking order, investigating whether the true chronological sequence might progress from most degraded to healthiest rather than the conventional assumption.
Technical Implementation
1. V18 Health Index Calculation
* Precisely replicated the proven V18 methodology:
   * RMS vibration level
   * Signal kurtosis with 10× scaling
   * Crest factor with 5× scaling
   * High-to-low frequency energy ratio with 2× scaling
* Computed identical health indices across all 53 files
* Maintained health index range: 79.04 to 112.85
2. Direction Reversal
* Applied inverse sorting by health index (highest to lowest)
* Assigned rank 1 to file with highest health index (most degraded)
* Assigned rank 53 to file with lowest health index (healthiest)
* Maintained all other V18 methodology parameters unchanged
Theoretical Basis
This approach tests several critical hypotheses:
* Potential data collection reversal (end-to-start recording)
* Alternative interpretation of degradation metrics
* Possibility that higher vibration characteristics indicate healthier states
* Fundamental challenge assumption verification
Key Investigation Areas
* If conventional bearing degradation physics assumptions apply
* Whether the challenge data follows expected degradation patterns
* Potential for counterintuitive system behavior
* Validation of the fundamental problem framing
Output Format
Submission provides reversed degradation ranks:
* Row 2: Rank of file_01.csv
* Row 3: Rank of file_02.csv
* Continuing through all 53 files with ranks 1-53
Strategic Importance
This submission represents a crucial paradigm test rather than methodological improvement. The outcome will either:
* Validate our current direction understanding, or
* Reveal a fundamental misunderstanding requiring complete strategy reassessment
Expected Outcomes
* Significant score improvement would indicate direction misunderstanding
* Similar scoring would confirm current direction assumption
* Either result provides critical strategic information for future attempts
*
