V5 METHODOLOGY: SPEED-NORMALIZED FEATURE ANALYSIS


This submission accounts for operational speed variations using tachometer data to uncover the true degradation signal.


Key Innovation:
- Uses zero-crossing tachometer timestamps to calculate true RPM
- Normalizes vibration features by actual operating conditions
- Adjusts bearing fault frequencies based on measured shaft speed


Technical Approach:
- Instantaneous RPM calculation from zct data
- RMS vibration normalized by shaft speed
- Bearing fault frequencies scaled by actual RPM
- Combined ranking using normalized features


Discovery:
Despite only 0.6% speed variation, normalization produces dramatically different rankings, suggesting operational conditions significantly impact vibration signatures.


This approach separates true degradation from operational effects.
