V17 METHODOLOGY: ADAPTIVE ENVELOPE SPECTRUM KURTOSIS
APPROACH:
Systematic, per-file optimization of frequency band selection using Envelope Spectrum Kurtosis (ESK) method. Adaptively finds the optimal resonance band for each degradation stage to maximize bearing fault periodicity detection.
CORE INNOVATION:
* Adaptive Band Selection: Each file's optimal frequency band is independently determined
* ESK Metric: Maximizes kurtosis of envelope spectrum in low-frequency range (0-500 Hz)
* Search Grid: Tests 40 center frequencies (1-40 kHz) × 3 bandwidths (2/4/6 kHz) per file
PHYSICAL BASIS:
* Resonance Tracking: Automatically finds actual bearing resonance frequencies as they evolve with degradation
* Fault Periodicity: ESK directly maximizes the periodic impulse train characteristic of bearing faults
* System Dynamics: Adapts to changing stiffness and resonance behavior throughout degradation
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. For each file, test 120 frequency band combinations
2. Select band that maximizes kurtosis of envelope spectrum
3. Extract envelope RMS from optimal band
4. Combine with simple RMS in Health Index (80%/20% weighting)
RESULTS:
* Health Index Range: 5.78 to 21.99 (3.8× dynamic range)
* Envelope RMS Range: 1.05 to 18.58 (17.7× dynamic range - massive improvement over V16)
* Optimal Bands: 9-38 kHz centers, predominantly 21 kHz center with 6 kHz bandwidth
ADVANTAGE OVER V16:
Replaces fixed band assumption with data-driven adaptive selection, resulting in significantly improved feature sensitivity to degradation progression.
