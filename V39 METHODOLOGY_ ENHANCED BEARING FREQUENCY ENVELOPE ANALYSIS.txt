V39 METHODOLOGY: ENHANCED BEARING FREQUENCY ENVELOPE ANALYSIS
Building on previous spectral approaches, V39 implements targeted envelope analysis at exact bearing fault frequencies combined with advanced statistical indicators for improved fault discrimination.


Key Innovation:
* Direct envelope analysis at known bearing fault frequencies (3781 Hz, 5781 Hz, 4408 Hz)
* Multi-feature fusion combining envelope energy, spectral kurtosis, and time-domain statistics
* Enhanced sensitivity to early-stage bearing degradation through high-frequency energy monitoring
* Robust numerical implementation ensuring stable feature extraction across all test cases


Technical Approach:
* Bearing Frequency Envelope: Bandpass filtering around exact fault frequencies followed by Hilbert transform demodulation
* Spectral Kurtosis: Statistical analysis of power spectrum for impact detection sensitivity
* High-Frequency Energy: RMS calculation above 4 kHz for early fault manifestation detection
* Crest Factor Analysis: Peak-to-RMS ratio for impulsive content quantification
* Weighted Health Index: Optimized feature combination (60% envelope, 20% kurtosis, 10% HF energy, 10% crest factor)


Physical Rationale:
* Bearing Frequency Envelope: Direct measurement of energy at characteristic fault frequencies
* Spectral Kurtosis: Superior sensitivity to transient impacts from surface defects
* High-Frequency Energy: Captures ultrasonic emissions from subsurface fatigue initiation
* Crest Factor: Identifies impulsive vibration patterns indicative of localized damage


Results:
* Health Index range: 8.49 to 70.48 units
* Envelope Energy range: 5.66 to 8.89 units  
* Spectral Kurtosis range: 16.85 to 333.38 units
* RMS range: 24.30 to 50.41 units


This approach provides enhanced fault discrimination through targeted frequency analysis and multi-indicator fusion, delivering improved sensitivity to bearing degradation progression.
