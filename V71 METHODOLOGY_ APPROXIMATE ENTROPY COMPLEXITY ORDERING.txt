V71 METHODOLOGY: APPROXIMATE ENTROPY COMPLEXITY ORDERING
Technical Approach:
* Signal Downsampling: 1000 evenly-spaced samples extracted from each 187,500-point vibration recording for computational efficiency
* Approximate Entropy Calculation: ApEn(m=2, r=0.2σ) computed for downsampled signals where m=pattern length and r=tolerance threshold scaled to signal standard deviation
* Regularity Quantification: ApEn measures signal predictability by comparing frequency of similar patterns of length m versus m+1
* Complexity-Based Ranking: Files ordered by ascending ApEn (low entropy = rank 1, high entropy = rank 53)
* No Amplitude Features: Approach excludes all energy-based metrics (RMS, peak, frequency band powers)
Physical Rationale:
* Healthy Bearing Signature: Undamaged bearings produce regular, periodic vibration patterns with high predictability (low ApEn) due to consistent contact mechanics and smooth load distribution
* Degradation-Induced Chaos: Bearing faults (pitting, spalling, wear) introduce irregular impacts and non-periodic excitations increasing signal complexity (high ApEn)
* Amplitude Independence: Entropy captures temporal structure independent of vibration magnitude; file with moderate RMS can exhibit high complexity if impact timing is irregular
* Monotonic Complexity Evolution: Progressive damage accumulation systematically reduces signal predictability as fault features develop
* Information-Theoretic Perspective: ApEn quantifies information content in vibration time series; degraded bearings carry more information due to increased variability in contact events
Results:
* Approximate Entropy range: 1.619922 to 1.720215 (6.2% variation across dataset)
* Most regular/healthiest (rank 1): file_05.csv (ApEn=1.620)
* Most complex/degraded (rank 53): file_17.csv (ApEn=1.720)
* Entropy-RMS decorrelation observed: highest entropy file exhibits moderate RMS (32.5), demonstrating independence of complexity from amplitude metrics
