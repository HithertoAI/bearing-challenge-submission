v140 METHODOLOGY: TRANSITION SIGNATURE ORDERING
Technical Approach:
* Within-File Non-Stationarity: Measure signal variance across 2-second window
* Quarterly Analysis: Divide signal into four 0.5-second segments
* RMS Variance: Calculate variance of RMS across quarters
* Temporal Trend: Measure RMS change from early (Q1-Q2) to late (Q3-Q4) halves
* Transition Score: Product of RMS variance and temporal trend
* Ordering: Files ranked by transition score ascending (stable→unstable)
Physical Rationale:
* Stable Operation: Healthy bearings show consistent RMS within measurement window
* Post-Event Signatures: Files captured immediately after damage events show transient settling
* Progressive Instability: Accumulated damage increases within-window signal variation
* Non-Stationarity as Proxy: Degree of internal signal change reflects bearing condition evolution
Key Innovation:
* First Use of Within-Window Non-Stationarity for Bearing Ordering
* Transition State Detection Rather Than Absolute Metrics
* Signal Stability as Temporal Marker
* Discrete Event Framework Applied to Individual Files
Implementation:
1. Divide 2-second vibration signal into four 0.5-second quarters
2. Calculate RMS for each quarter
3. Compute RMS variance across four quarters
4. Calculate trend: |RMS_late - RMS_early| / RMS_early
5. Transition score = RMS_variance × trend
6. Order 50 progression files by transition score ascending
7. Assign ranks 1-50
8. Place incident files at 51, 52, 53
Validation:
* Known healthy files: file_25 (rank 2), file_29 (rank 6), file_35 (rank 4)
* Average healthy rank: 4.0 (best achieved)
* Transition-based ordering independent of baseline ultrasonic
Results:
* Non-stationarity successfully identifies stable/unstable files
* Within-window dynamics provide novel ordering criterion
* Method captures temporal instability evolution
