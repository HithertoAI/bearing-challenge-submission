V54 METHODOLOGY: TAR (THRESHOLD AUTOREGRESSION) NONLINEAR DYNAMICS ANALYSIS
Technical Approach:
* Regime-Switching Autoregression: TAR model fitting to detect behavioral transitions between healthy and damaged bearing states
* Threshold Detection: Optimal threshold identification for regime separation based on variance reduction criteria
* Parameter Divergence Measurement: Quantification of autoregressive coefficient differences between operational regimes
* Sample Entropy Analysis: Complexity and irregularity assessment of vibration signal time-series structure
* Nonlinearity Index Computation: Surrogate data testing to distinguish deterministic nonlinear dynamics from stochastic processes
* Multi-Feature Nonlinear Health Index: Weighted combination of regime parameters, entropy, and nonlinearity indicators
Physical Rationale:
* Nonlinear Contact Mechanics: Bearing damage introduces regime-dependent behavior through load redistribution and contact stiffness changes
* Deterministic Chaos Emergence: Progressive degradation increases system complexity measurable through entropy growth
* Threshold Crossing Dynamics: Damaged bearings exhibit distinct behavioral regimes below and above critical amplitude thresholds
* Nonlinear Force Transmission: Spalling and crack propagation create amplitude-dependent response characteristics invisible to linear analysis
* Beyond Classical Diagnostics: Captures nonlinear behavioral changes that frequency-domain energy methods cannot detect
Results:
* Parameter difference range: 0.1219 to 0.2557
* Variance ratio range: 0.8380 to 1.1486
* Sample entropy range: 1.7563 to 2.7161
* Nonlinearity index range: 0.0359 to 0.0941
* Health Index range: 0.1794 to 0.7409
This nonlinear dynamics approach fundamentally departs from frequency-domain methods by modeling regime-switching behavior and deterministic complexity in bearing degradation processes.
