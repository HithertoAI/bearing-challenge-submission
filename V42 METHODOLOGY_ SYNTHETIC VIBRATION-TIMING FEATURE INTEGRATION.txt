V42 METHODOLOGY: SYNTHETIC VIBRATION-TIMING FEATURE INTEGRATION
Novel approach combining vibration data with zero-crossing timing to create synchronized operational health indicators.


Technical Approach:
* Revolution-Synchronized Vibration Analysis: Vibration energy distribution across individual rotational cycles
* Speed Stability Measurement: Rotational consistency derived from zero-crossing interval variations  
* Phase-Synchronized Peak Detection: Vibration peak occurrence relative to rotational phase position
* Multi-Domain Feature Fusion: Integrated health index combining timing stability and vibration characteristics


Physical Rationale:
* Vibration per Revolution Variability: Degrading bearings exhibit inconsistent vibration patterns across rotations
* Rotational Stability: Bearing wear introduces speed variations detectable in timing precision
* Phase Synchronization: Healthy bearings show consistent vibration peak phasing; degradation disrupts this pattern
* Combined Domain Sensitivity: Integration reveals failure modes invisible to single-domain analysis


Results:
* Health Index range: 1.48 to 3.44 units
* Vibration per Revolution Ratio: 0.054 to 0.160
* Speed Stability: 0.00014 to 0.00166
* Peak Phase Standard Deviation: 0.277 to 0.298


This synthetic feature approach provides unique insights into bearing degradation through synchronized time-vibration analysis.
