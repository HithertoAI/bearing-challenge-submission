V19 METHODOLOGY: MULTIPLICATIVE FEATURE COMBINATION
APPROACH:
Strategic shift from additive to multiplicative feature combination based on DeepThink analysis. Amplifies co-occurring degradation signals while maintaining robustness.
CORE INNOVATION:
* Multiplicative Health Index: HI = RMS_norm × EnergyRatio_norm × (1 + 0.3×Kurtosis_norm) × (1 + 0.2×Crest_norm)
* Gentle Weighting: Kurtosis and Crest Factor contribute multiplicatively without dominating
* Amplified Separation: Creates strong differentiation between degradation states
PHYSICAL BASIS:
* Bearing degradation is multiplicative - energy increases AND frequency distribution shifts simultaneously
* Co-occurring feature changes indicate true degradation progression
* Multiplicative combination penalizes inconsistent feature behavior
RESULTS:
* Health Index Range: 0.0000 to 0.6748 (infinite dynamic range)
* Feature Normalization: All features scaled to [0,1] range
* Strong Separation: Clear differentiation between health states
STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE:
Builds on V18's proven feature set while implementing the minimal change (multiplicative vs additive) recommended by systematic analysis for maximum 8-point gap closure probability.
