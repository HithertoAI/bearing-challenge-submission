V14 METHODOLOGY: EM TRANSIENT ANALYSIS - revised


Revisiting our successful V6 approach with corrected physical parameters.


APPROACH:
- RMS vibration energy (proven baseline indicator)
- High-pass filtering (1000 Hz) to isolate EM transient bursts
- Peak detection on filtered signal (height = 2σ, distance adapted for 93.75kHz)
- Combined metric: RMS + (Transient Energy × 0.1 weighting)


RATIONALE:
- RMS captures overall vibration increase from bearing wear
- EM transients detect early-stage fault signatures and electrical noise
- Combined approach proven effective in V6 submission
- Now recalculated with correct 93,750 Hz sample rate


PHYSICAL PARAMETERS:
Sample Rate: 93,750 Hz (corrected from previous 25,600 Hz assumption)
High-pass cutoff: 1000 Hz for transient isolation
Peak distance: Adapted for proper sampling frequency


RESULTS:
64,735 transient peaks detected across dataset
RMS range: 24.30 to 50.41
