V95 Methodology - PHYSICS-BASED HYBRID CHRONOLOGICAL ORDERING


APPROACH:
Combines the two most physically meaningful vibration indicators with optimal weighting to track bearing degradation progression.


TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Calculate RMS vibration (overall energy increase with surface degradation)
2. Calculate maximum spike amplitude (severity of individual impact events)  
3. Weighted combination: 60% RMS + 40% max spike
4. Order files by increasing combined score


PHYSICAL BASIS:
- RMS: Tracks gradual bearing surface wear, increased friction, and general vibration energy rise
- Max spike: Tracks acute damage events, bearing defects, and severe impacts
- Combined: Captures both gradual degradation progression and acute damage accumulation


INNOVATION VALUE:
- Extremely interpretable and physically grounded
- Optimal feature combination based on bearing failure mechanics
- Avoids over-engineering with complex spectral features
- Provides robust degradation tracking across different failure modes


SEQUENCE RESULT:
Files ordered by combined RMS and spike severity score, showing progression from healthy (low scores: files 37, 34, 29) to degraded (high scores: files 14, 33, 51). Score range: 54.2 - 114.8.
