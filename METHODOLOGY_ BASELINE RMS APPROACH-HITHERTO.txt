METHODOLOGY: BASELINE RMS APPROACH


Development Approach:
- Initial data exploration of vibration signals and tachometer data
- Extraction of RMS (Root Mean Square) vibration amplitude as primary degradation indicator
- Assumption: bearing degradation causes monotonic increase in overall vibration energy
- Files ranked from lowest to highest RMS values


Modeling Approach:
- Simple feature-based ranking using time-domain vibration characteristics
- No complex machine learning - relies on physical understanding of bearing degradation
- Each file processed independently, then globally sorted by RMS value


Key Assumptions:
1. Bearing degradation progresses monotonically (bearings don't heal)
2. Overall vibration energy increases with degradation severity
3. Operational variations are secondary to degradation trends


Observations:
- RMS values range from 24.30 to 50.41 across files, suggesting meaningful degradation progression
- Data quality is excellent with consistent 2-second recordings at 93,750 Hz
- Ready for more sophisticated feature extraction in subsequent submissions


Next Steps Planned:
- Spectral analysis of bearing fault frequencies
- Envelope analysis for impact detection
- Speed normalization using tachometer data
- Multi-feature ensemble approaches
