V40 METHODOLOGY: CLEAN BEARING FREQUENCY ENERGY ANALYSIS
Addressing computational stability issues from previous complex approaches, V40 implements a robust, focused analysis on bearing frequency energy content while ensuring reliable execution.


Key Innovation:
* Simplified, computationally stable feature extraction
* Direct focus on bearing frequency bands (3-5 kHz and 5-7 kHz)


Technical Approach:
* Welch Power Spectral Density: 1024-point segments for stable frequency analysis
* Bearing Frequency Energy: Summed energy in primary bearing fault bands (3-5 kHz and 5-7 kHz)
* Health Index: Pure bearing energy measurement (higher energy = more severe fault)
* Stable Ranking: Simple sorting without complex weighting schemes


Physical Rationale:
* Bearing Frequency Energy: Direct measurement of vibration energy in frequency ranges characteristic of bearing faults
* Progressive Degradation: Higher energy in bearing bands indicates advancing fault severity


Results:
* Bearing Energy range: 0.83 to 3.66 units
* RMS range: 24.30 to 50.41 units
